In the exercises for this section, you will find such practice exercises.    Rate Models  A rate is a measurement that tells us how much one quantity is changing with Rate respect to how some other quantity is changing. For example, the number of people on earth is growing by about people per second. Time is passing second by second, and as that change in time happens, we have a net gain of about people. The rate we are discussing is . Note that the unit on this rate is fractional this is common with rates.  One common class of modeling applications involve rates like these. Let's examine a first example.   Your savings account starts with . Then each month, there is an automatic deposit of . You need to afford a deposit on a new apartment. Write an equation where the solution represents how much time this will take.  Do you have an understanding of each of the numbers in this setting, and what they truly mean in context? The is a number that only matters once in the story of this bank account: it is how much money was there when we started making automatic deposits. The also only matters once : at the end, we will have that much money.  But the is different. Month after month, the account balance goes up by . This number is used repeatedly in the scenario. It might look like it's just a dollar amount, but it's actually a rate : it's .  If you have any uncertainty about understanding a rate value, it can help to make a table. We know the account balance is changing month by month, so it makes sense to track the months and the account balance.       Months Since  Saving Started    Total Amount Saved  (in Dollars)                     In the first column, we go up by one month from one row to the next. In the second column, we go up by from one row to the next. If you are able to build a table like this, then you are dealing with a rate. In the second column, values increase by dollars. In the first column, values increase by month. The rate we are working with comes from dividing these: , which is just .  Now that we've spent time making sure we understand the meaning of the numbers in this story, we can try to do what we were asked to do: write an equation where the solution represents how much time it will take to reach . It's kind of a big deal to clearly identify what variable we will use. Our task is to write an equation where the solution represents how much time and we are measuring time in months. So one perfectly fine choice we can make is to let be our variable, where stands for the number of months it will take to reach . (Another common choice would be to use , since it stands for an amount of time.)  What will the equation look like? For this example, let's return to the table we made earlier. Was there a pattern connecting the left column to the right column? For example in the left column there is a row where months have passed. At that time, we have . How did that come about? Well, we started with and then added not once, not twice, but three times. As an equation: Thinking in this way, we can grow the table to show this pattern and extend it to when months have passed, even without a value in mind for .   Amount in Savings Account        Months Since  Saving Started    Total Amount Saved  (in Dollars)                                         We want there to be at the end, so apparently we want: And that was our objective: to write down that equation. Right now we are not interested in actually solving this equation. The skill of setting up that equation is challenging enough, and this section only focuses on that setup.   There are some things worth noticing in this last example. There was a starting value for the account balance ( ), a rate at which the account balance was changing ( ), and a final value ( $1700 ). In the end, we had the equation and the variable represented how much the other quantity (time in this case, not the account balance) has changed. The is a if the quantity is growing, and is a if the quantity is reducing. This is a common setup for modeling with rates.    A bathtub contains  2.5  of water. More water is being poured in at a rate of  1.75  per minute. Write an equation where the solution represents when the amount of water in the bathtub will reach  6.25  .    In this example, we have an initial amount of water (  2.5  ), a rate at which the amount of water is changing (  1.75  ), and a final amount of water we are going to reach (  6.25  ). So we can use the pattern for rate modeling from .  We should clearly identify the variable first though. The solution is supposed to represent an amount of time. So a reasonable variable to use is . Let be the amount of time, in minutes, that it takes for the tub to reach  6.25  . And we have the equation: (We are not concerned with solving this equation at this time.)       In the year 2020, the world population was billion. And it was growing at a rate of about At this rate, how many years from 2020 will it take for the world population to reach billion? Set up an equation where the solution is the number of years it will take.        Since the solution will represent an amount of time, we choose to use as the variable. Let be the number of years from 2020 until the world population reaches 9 billion.  Now using the pattern for rate modeling from (1.1.1), we have:   We are not asked to solve this equation, just to write it down.           In the year 2020, the population of Bulgaria was million. And it was declining at a rate of about At this rate, how many years from 2020 will it take for Bulgaria s population to reach million? Set up an equation where the solution is the number of years it will take.        Since the solution will represent an amount of time, we choose to use as the variable. Let be the number of years from 2020 until Bulgaria s population reaches 5 million.  Now using the pattern for rate modeling from (1.1.1), we have:   Notice that because the population is reducing over time, we used subtraction. In effect, the rate of growth is negative. We are not asked to solve this equation, just to write it down.          Percent Applications  Percent applications  Here we look at some scenarios where there is an equation to set up based on percentages. One important consideration is that when doing math with percentages, it's almost always best to rewrite each percentage as a decimal. For example, should be written as Percent as a decimal  if you are going to use it to do algebra or arithmetic.    Jakobi's annual salary as a nurse this year is . That's following a raise over last year's salary. Write a linear equation modeling this scenario, where the goal is to find Jakobi's salary from the previous year.    As soon as you understand that the solution will be Jakobi's salary from last year, that is when you should clearly define a variable. Since it will represent a salary, we choose to use as the variable. Let represent Jakobi's salary from last year.  To set up the equation, we need to think about how he arrived at this year's salary. His employer took last year's salary and added to that. In a diagram, we have: We represent of last year's salary with since is the decimal equivalent to . So out equation is: For now we are not trying to solve this equation, just practice setting it up.    We can see a pattern here that may help with future percent applications. In Jakobi's situation, his salary rose, so the symbol would be an addition sign. We can imagine other applications (like a discount at a clothing store) where the initial value is reduced, and then the symbol would be a subtraction sign.  Note the variable in Jakobi's situation is an initial value and it appears twice in the equation. This is common with percent application modeling.     Kirima offered to pay the bill and tip at a restaurant where she and her friends had dinner. In total she paid even, which meant the tip was a little more than We d like to know what was the bill before tip. Set up an equation for this situation.        A common mistake is to translate a question like this into what is of as a way to calculate the tip amount, and then subtract that from But that is not how tipping works. The is applied to the original bill , not the final total . So please read carefully.  If we let represent the original bill, we can apply (1.1.2) and we have:   Again, we are not currently trying to solve this equation, just write it down.          The cost of a refrigerator after a discount is . Write a linear equation modeling this scenario where the original price of the refrigerator (before the discount was applied) is the solution.    We'll let be the original price of the refrigerator. To obtain the discounted price, we would have to take the original price and subtract  of that amount. In a diagram, we have: So given the details of this refrigerator sale and our choice to use to represent the original price, we have: We are happy to write this equation down and do not need to solve it for now.       A shirt is on sale for off. The sale price is Write an equation based on this scenario where the solution represents the shirt s original price.        Let represent the original price of the shirt. Since is removed to bring the cost down to we can set up the equation:   This equation s solution will be the original price of the shirt, but for now we do not need to solve the equation.          Inequalities in Modeling  Occasionally an equation is not the most appropriate tool for a model, and an inequality is better. To identify when an inequality is more appropriate, look for words\/phrases like at least , at most , minimum , maximum , no more than , no less than , and more.    The car share company Zipcar has a one-time registration fee of and charges per hour for use of their vehicles. Hana wants to use Zipcar this semester and has a maximum budget of . Write a linear inequality representing this scenario, where the solution set represents how many hours total this semester that she could use a Zipcar vehicle.    The solution will represent a number of hours which is an amount of time. So we choose to use as the variable. Let be the number of hours that Hana drives a Zipcar this semester.  This exercise is much like the rate exercises from . We have an initial expense: the one-time registration fee. We have a rate: . And we have a final cost to work with: . However we are not exactly trying to make Hana blow through her entire budget, so it's not appropriate to write the equation  . The is her maximum . It's totally fine (and encouraged!) for her to spend less than that. So we need to set this up using an inequality symbol. We need For now it is enough to write down this inequality, and we will solve it later.       You read on the internet that from the year 2010 to the year 2023, community colleges experienced over enrollment decline. In spring 2023 at Portland Community College, there were students. Write an inequality where the solution set represents how many students may have been at PCC in spring 2010.        We decide to let represent the number of students enrolled at PCC in spring 2010. This is an initial value in the sense of (1.1.2). But we do not want to write an equation, because we were told that community colleges experienced over a enrollment decline, not exactly a decline. So we write the following:   But what inequality symbol makes sense here? If the decline was more than then started out larger than what it would have to be for to equal So we need a greater than sign:   Once again, we will not try to solve this at this time.            In a word problem where there is some kind of rate, it can help you to understand the pattern if you make a .       It is common to come across a word problem where some percent is either added or subtracted from an unknown original value. With the approach described in this section for setting up an equation, how many times will you use the variable in such an equation?       Is there any difference between these three phrases, or do they all mean the same thing?  ten subtracted from a number  ten less than a number  ten minus a number          Review and Warmup     Identify a variable you might use to represent each quantity. Then identify what units would be most appropriate.    Let be the area of a house, measured in .             The unknown quantity is area. The area of a house is usually measured in square feet. So we ll define this variable as:  Let be the area of a house, measured in     Let be the age of a dog, measured in .             The unknown quantity is age, which we generally measure in years. So we could define this variable as:  Let be the age of a dog, measured in years.     Let be the amount of time passed since a driver left Seattle, Washington, bound for Portland, Oregon, measured in .             The amount of time passed is the unknown quantity. Since this is a drive from Seattle to Portland, it would make sense to measure this in hours. So we could define this variable as:  Let be the amount of time passed since a driver left Seattle, Washington, bound for Portland, Oregon, measured in hours.            Identify a variable you might use to represent each quantity. Then identify what units would be most appropriate.    Let be the age of a person, measured in .             The unknown quantity is age, which we generally measure in years. So we could define this variable as:  Let be the age of a person, measured in years.     Let be the distance traveled by a driver that left Portland, Oregon, bound for Boise, Idaho, measured in .             The distance traveled is the unknown quantity. Since this is a drive from Portland to Boise, it would make sense to measure this in miles. So we could define this variable as:  Let be the distance traveled by a driver that left Portland, Oregon, bound for Boise, Idaho, measured in miles.     Let be the surface area of the walls of a room, measured in .             The unknown quantity is area. Apartment area is usually measured in square feet. So we ll define this variable as:  Let be the area of a two-bedroom apartment, measured in           Skills Practice   Translating English into Math   Translate the phrase or sentence into a math expression or equation (whichever is appropriate).      nine more than a number                ten less than a number                the sum of two and a number                the difference between a number and three                four subtracted from a number                five increased by a number                six decreased by a number                eleven times a number, decreased by fourteen                twelve times a number, increased by nine                fourteen times a number decreased by four                fifteen times a number increased by thirteen                three more than the product of nine and a number                five less than the product of four and a number                six more than the quotient of a number and thirteen                eight less than the quotient of a number and nine                eight thirteenths of a number                ten thirteenths of a number                a number increased by twelve fifths of itself                a number decreased by thirteen twelfths of itself                fifteen less than eleven times a number                three more than seven times a number                Nineteen more than a number is twelve.

The product of eight and four more than a number is nine.                The sum of nine and a number is the same as fourteen times that number.                Eleven times a number is the same as eight less than twice that number.

At the moment the passenger makes their observation, the plane is still descending, so the altitude is greater than the final value. So our inequality is:            Colt s current annual salary as a high school teacher is This is with a raise by more than over last year s salary. What might his salary have been last year? Set up an inequality where the solution set represents the possible answers to this question. There is no need to solve it.

The is a number that only matters once in the story of this bank account: it is how much money was there when we started making automatic deposits. The also only matters once : at the end, we will have that much money.  But the is different. Month after month, the account balance goes up by . This number is used repeatedly in the scenario. It might look like it's just a dollar amount, but it's actually a rate : it's .  If you have any uncertainty about understanding a rate value, it can help to make a table.

In the first column, values increase by month. The rate we are working with comes from dividing these: , which is just .  Now that we've spent time making sure we understand the meaning of the numbers in this story, we can try to do what we were asked to do: write an equation where the solution represents how much time it will take to reach . It's kind of a big deal to clearly identify what variable we will use. Our task is to write an equation where the solution represents how much time and we are measuring time in months. So one perfectly fine choice we can make is to let be our variable, where stands for the number of months it will take to reach . (Another common choice would be to use , since it stands for an amount of time.)  What will the equation look like? For this example, let's return to the table we made earlier. Was there a pattern connecting the left column to the right column? For example in the left column there is a row where months have passed. At that time, we have . How did that come about? Well, we started with and then added not once, not twice, but three times. As an equation: Thinking in this way, we can grow the table to show this pattern and extend it to when months have passed, even without a value in mind for .

There are a few standard steps to learn, and then isolating the variable in a linear equation becomes second nature.   Alternative Video Lessons      Solving Two-Step Equations  Equation(s) using both addition and multiplication properties   A water tank can hold up to gallons of water, but it starts with only gallons. A tap is opened, pouring gallons of water into the tank every minute. How long will it take to fill the tank?  This is a scenario describing a rate . We can explore what is happening with a table. Tables can reveal patterns that help understand what is happening better.       Time Tap Running  (in Minutes)    Water in Tank  (in Gallons)          ( )     ( )     ( )     ( )        Each additional minute of time gives us more gallons of water. So after minutes, we've added gallons of water to the gallons that we started with. And after minutes, we have gallons total. To find when the tank will be full with gallons, we can write the equation   To solve this, first we isolate the variable term, . We need to remove the from the left side of the equation. We can do this in a legal way using the subtraction property of equality by subtracting from each side of the equation. Once the variable term is isolated, we can eliminate its coefficient and solve for .   The full process is:   We should check this possible solution by substituting in for in the original equation: And the solution is verified.   This problem had context . It was not simply solving an equation. It came with a story about a tank filling with water. So we should report a conclusion that uses that context. Something like The tank will be full after minutes.    In solving the two-step equation in , we first isolated the variable expression and then eliminated the coefficient by dividing each side of the equation by . These two steps are the heart of our approach to solving linear equations. Try these two steps in the following exercise.     Solve for in the equation        To solve, we first separate the variable terms and constant terms to different sides of the equation. Then we eliminate the variable term s coefficient.   Checking the solution   So the solution to the equation is and the solution set is        In , there was . In that example, some background information let us set up an equation, but we didn't try to solve it. Now we can try solving it.     Your savings account starts with Then each month, there is an automatic deposit of You need to afford a deposit on a new apartment. How long will this take?        With any word problem, it is best to clearly define the variable you will use once you really understand what the question is asking for. In this case, we let (for time) be the number of months until you have saved up  To set up an equation, we might start by making a table in order to identify a general pattern for the total amount in the savings account after months.       Time Passed (in Months)  Account Balance (in Dollars)         ( more than )     ( more than )     ( more than )     ( more than )        We find the pattern is that after months, the total amount saved is Using this pattern, we set up the equation   to represent when we will have saved up To solve this equation, we start by subtracting from each side. Then we can divide each side by   Checking the solution   So is the solution, and it checks out. This means it will take months for the account balance to reach          Solving Multistep Linear Equations  More complicated equations might need a few setup steps before we can do the two important steps of isolating the variable term and eliminating the coefficient. Here is a general guide for what the full process can be like.   Steps to Solve Linear Equations  Solving linear equations multistep   Linear equations solving    Simplify  Simplify the expressions on each side of the equation by distributing and combining like terms.    Separate  Use addition or subtraction to separate the terms so that the variable terms are on one side of the equation and the constant terms are on the other side of the equation.    Clear the Coefficient  Use multiplication or division to eliminate the variable term's coefficient.    Check  Check the solution in the original equation. Substitute values into the original equation and use the order of operations to simplify both sides. It's important to use the order of operations alone rather than properties like the distributive law. Otherwise you might repeat the same arithmetic errors you (might have) made while solving, and fail to catch an incorrect solution.    Summarize  State the solution set. Or in the case of an application problem, summarize the result in a complete sentence using appropriate units.       Ahmed has in his savings account and is going to start saving per month. Julia has in her savings account and is going to start saving per month. If this situation continues, how long will it take for Ahmed to catch up with Julia in savings?  Ahmed saves per month, so he can save dollars in months. With the he started with, after months he has dollars. Similarly, after months, Julia has dollars. To find when those two accounts will have the same amount of money, we write the equation Each side is simplified, but unlike earlier examples, we have the variable on both side of the equation. But we can still use properties of equality to have only one -term. We can start by subtracting from each side. Checking the solution :   Ahmed will catch up to Julia after months.      Solve for in         Checking the solution   Therefore the solution is and the solution set is        In , we could have moved variable terms to the right side of the equal sign and number terms to the left side. We chose not to, but there's no reason why we couldn't have done that. Let's explore: The solution is the same either way.  Also, we could save a step by moving variable terms and constant terms in one step: For the sake of a slow and careful explanation, the examples in this chapter will move variable terms and number terms in separate steps.  The next example requires combining like terms.    Solve for in .    We start by combining like terms. After this, we can separate the -terms and constant terms, proceeding as before.      Checking the solution :    The solution to the equation is and the solution set is .      Solve for in .    This time we start by simplifying each side of the equation, which involves distributing as well as combining like terms. Here is a reminder to be careful when distributing a negative sign over a group of terms.      Checking the solution :    Therefore the solution to the equation is and the solution set is .       Solve for in         Checking the solution   Therefore the solution is and the solution set is          Revisiting Applications  In , we explored several word problem scenarios that led to equations, but we did not try to solve those equations. Let's revisit some of those applications and try to solve them.  Here we revisit .    A bathtub contains  2.5  of water. More water is being poured in at a rate of  1.75  per minute. How long will it be until the amount of water in the bathtub reaches  6.25  ?    We have an initial amount of water (  2.5  ), a rate at which the amount of water is changing (  1.75  ), and a final amount of water we are going to reach (  6.25  ). So we can use the pattern for rate modeling from .  We should clearly identify the variable first though. The solution is supposed to represent an amount of time. So a reasonable variable to use is . Let be the amount of time, in minutes, that it takes for the tub to reach  6.25  . And we have the equation: Now we have the skills to solve this equation. So it will take about minutes for the tub to have  6.25  of water.    Here we revisit .    Jakobi's annual salary as a nurse this year is . That's following a raise over last year's salary. What was his salary the previous year?    As soon as you understand that the solution will be Jakobi's salary from last year, that is when you should clearly define a variable. Since it will represent a salary, we choose to use as the variable. Let represent Jakobi's salary from last year.  To set up the equation, we need to think about how he arrived at this year's salary. His employer took last year's salary and added to that. In words, we have: We represent of last year's salary with since is the decimal equivalent to . So out equation is: Now we have the skills to solve this equation. So last year, Jakobi's salary was about .    Here we revisit .     A shirt is on sale for off. The sale price is What was the shirt s original price?        Let represent the original price of the shirt. Since is removed to bring the cost down to we can set up the equation:   Now we have the skills to solve this equation.   The shirt s original price was          Differentiating between Simplifying Expressions, Evaluating Expressions and Solving Equations  Consider the following three examples, which have similarities on the surface, but are fundamentally different from each other.

Students often use these vocabulary terms incorrectly, using one when they meant another. Here is a summary collection of the differences that you should understand between these algebra tasks.   A summary the differences between simplifying expressions, evaluating expressions, and solving equations.    An expression like can be simplified to (as in ). However we cannot solve an expression like this. It is incorrect to say you will solve .    An expression like can be evaluated , but only once you have a number to use in place of the variable. This is what happens in , where , and the expression evaluates to .    An equation connects two expressions with an equal sign. In , has one expression on either side of equal sign. You can solve this equation, because it is an equation. You can also solve inequalities. You just cannot solve an expression like .

To find when those two accounts will have the same amount of money, we write the equation Each side is simplified, but unlike earlier examples, we have the variable on both side of the equation. But we can still use properties of equality to have only one -term. We can start by subtracting from each side. Checking the solution :   Ahmed will catch up to Julia after months.  "

  "body": " Solving Multistep Linear Inequalities   We solved inequalities in where only one step was needed to isolate the variable. Now we will work with inequalities that need more than one step.   Alternative Video Lessons      Solving Multistep Inequalities  When solving a linear inequality, we almost follow the exact same steps as we do in Process . One difference is that when we multiply or divide by a negative number on both sides of an inequality, the direction of the inequality symbol must switch. The other difference is that checking a solution set takes more effort.   Steps to Solve Linear Inequalities  Solving linear inequalities multistep  Linear inequalities solving  Equation(s) using both addition and multiplication properties     Simplify  Simplify the expressions on each side of the inequality by distributing and combining like terms.    Separate  Use addition or subtraction to separate the terms so that the variable terms are on one side of the inequality and the constant terms are on the other side of the inequality.    Clear the Coefficient  Use multiplication or division to eliminate the variable term's coefficient. If you multiply or divide each side by a negative number, switch the direction of the inequality symbol.     Check  A solution to a linear inequality has a boundary number . Using the original inequality, check (1) a number less than the boundary number, (2) the boundary number itself, and (3) a number greater than the boundary number to confirm what should and shouldn't be solutions are all working as expected. (This can take time, so use your judgment about when you might get away with skipping this checking.)    Summarize  State the solution set. Or in the case of an application problem, summarize the result in a complete sentence using appropriate units.        Solve for in the inequality . Write the solution set in both set-builder notation and interval notation.    We'll handle this much like we would handle an equation, at least for the first step.   Note that when we divided both sides of the inequality by , we had to switch the direction of the inequality symbol. At this point we think that the solution set in set-builder notation is , and the solution set in interval notation is .  Since there are infinitely many solutions, it's impossible to literally check them all. We believe that all values of for which are solutions. We check that one number less than (any number, your choice) satisfies the inequality. And that satisfies the inequality. And that one number greater than (any number, your choice) does not satisfy the inequality. We choose to check the values , , and .   a number line with a mark at -2; a thick line overlays the number line to the left of -2 with an arrow pointing left; there is a right bracket at -2; three arrows point to -10, -2, and 0 on the number line, suggesting that these values will be checked as possible solutions     So both and are solutions as expected, while is not. This is evidence that our solution set is correct. Making these checks would help us catch an error if we had made one. While it certainly does take time and space to make three checks like this, it has its value.      Solve for in the inequality . Write the solution set in both set-builder notation and interval notation.    Here, our first step will be simplifying the left side.   Note that we divided both sides of the inequality by and since this is a positive number we did not need to switch the direction of the inequality symbol. At this point we think that the solution set in set-builder notation is , and the solution set in interval notation is .  Since there are infinitely many solutions, it's impossible to literally check them all. We believe that all values of for which are solutions.

This is evidence that our solution set is correct. The solution set in set-builder notation is . The solution set in interval notation is .       Solve the inequality Graph the solution set on a number line. State the solution set using both interval notation and set-builder notation.                  We start by simplifying the two sides.   And now add\/subtract terms to separate the variable terms and the constant terms.   And now divide each side by Since we are dividing by a negative number, the inequality sign will change direction.   Graphically, we represent this solution set as:    Using interval notation, we write the solution set as Using set-builder notation, we write it as  We should check that some number less than  is a solution, that itself is not a solution, and that some number greater than is not a solution.    Everything worked out as expected, so our solution is reasonably checked.          Applications   Rate Problem   When an experiment started, the pressure inside a gas container was atm (one atm is the standard pressure air at sea level). As the container was heated, the pressure increased by atm per minute. The maximum pressure the container is rated to handle is atm. Heating must be stopped once the pressure reaches atm. Over what time interval was the container in a safe state (meaning the pressure was less than or equal to atm)?    This is a situation where something had an initial value (the pressure starts at atm) and then changed at a constant rate (it increased by atm per minute). So we can use the rate model formula . Except we are not exactly interested in the pressure equaling the final value of atm. Instead, we are asked about when the pressure was less than or equal to  atm. So we have the inequality:   In summary, the container was safe as long as . Assuming that the time also must be greater than or equal to zero, this means . We can write this as the time interval as . Thus the container was safe between minutes and minutes.     Percent Problem   The population of a certain country grew by over the course of the past decade. One town in this country grew in population too, but not as fast as the country did overall. Its current population is . What might its population have been ten years ago?    Let be the town's population from ten years ago. If the town had grown by , then it's population would be . But since it actually grew less quickly than per decade, would work out to more than the town's current population of . So we have the inequality:   So the town's population from ten years ago was at least .        When solving an inequality, what are the conditions when you have to reverse the direction of the inequality symbol?       How is the solution set to a linear inequality different from the solution set to a linear equation?

This cab service charges a flat fee of and then charges per mile. No tip is expected. You are carrying a total of in cash with you. You want to know how many miles you can afford.    Write an inequality to represent this situation, using to represent how many miles you can afford.          Solve this inequality. At most how many miles can you afford?          Use interval notation to express the number of miles you might ride that day.                 Alexa is driving on the highway, and presently has 12 gal of gasoline in her tank. Her car, under ideal conditions , uses gas at a rate of 0.05 gal\/mi. When the tank reaches only one gallon of gas, the low gas light will turn on and Alexa will start looking for a gas station. How far will she drive before this happens?    Write an inequality to represent this situation, using to represent how many miles Alexa might drive before the low gas light turns on.        This is a rate exercise, and we can use   The question mark in the above is not an equal sign, because we are trying to set up an inequality. The initial value for the gas in her tank is Alexa is losing gas (so we will subtract, not add), the rate is and the gas amount we are interested in reaching is We do not know far Alexa can drive until the gas gets that low, and we decide to use to represent that distance. The rate of gas consumption we are using is only valid under ideal conditions. So the quantity will be greater than or equal to the actual amount of gas left in the tank after driving miles. And we want this to reach So the inequality we set up is:      Solve this inequality. At most how far will Alexa drive before the low gas light turns on?         So Alexa can drive at most miles.     Use interval notation to express the number of miles Alexa might drive before the low gas light turns on.        Alexa can drive at most miles, so the right end of the interval notation for this interval will be with a bracket. We know Alexa has more than 1 gallon of gas when this all started, so she can drive at least some positive number of miles. So the interval notation, accounting for the context of this exercise, is            Water straight out of the tap is degrees Fahrenheit, and you fill a tea kettle. You place the tea kettle on an old stove burner and turn on the burner, but the heating element is old and not working well. At best , it begins raising the temperature inside the kettle at a rate of degrees Fahrenheit per minute. How long will it take to boil the water? (Water boils at degrees Fahrenheit.)    Write an inequality to represent this situation, using to represent how many minutes it will take for the water to boil.          Solve this inequality. At best, how long will it take for the water to boil?          Use interval notation to express the number of minutes it might take for the water to boil.                 Donavan is a runner, and set out this morning on a jog with a goal to reach a nearby summit and return home in under one hour. He jogged a steady uphill path to the top of the nearby summit, and it took 34 min to get there. Now jogging home, he will run a distance of 2.4 mi. What will his rate (in minutes per mile) need to be in order to make the goal of returning home in under 60 minutes?    Write an inequality to represent this situation, using to represent Donavan s jogging rate in minutes per mile.          Solve this inequality. Donavan s jogging rate needs to beat what rate?          Use interval notation to express what Donavan s jogging rate (in minutes per mile) might be.                 The population of a certain country grew by over the course of the past decade. One city in this country grew in population too, but at an even faster rate than the country grew overall. The city s current population is What might its population have been ten years ago? (Note: the population ten years ago is known to have been at least )    Write an inequality to represent this situation, using to represent the city s population from ten years ago.          Solve this inequality. What s the most the population could have been ten years ago?          Use interval notation to express what the city s population could have been ten years ago.                 The bill at a restaurant came and Jailyn offered to pay for the whole table. We are not sure what the bill was, but it was at least Jailyn added a tip, and the total came to We are sure that she added at least  tip. What might the original bill total have been before tip?    Write an inequality to represent this situation, using to represent the bill total before tip was added.          Solve this inequality. What s the most the bill could have been before tip?          Use interval notation to express what the bill could have been before tip was added.                "

Over what time interval was the container in a safe state (meaning the pressure was less than or equal to atm)?    This is a situation where something had an initial value (the pressure starts at atm) and then changed at a constant rate (it increased by atm per minute). So we can use the rate model formula . Except we are not exactly interested in the pressure equaling the final value of atm. Instead, we are asked about when the pressure was less than or equal to  atm. So we have the inequality:   In summary, the container was safe as long as . Assuming that the time also must be greater than or equal to zero, this means . We can write this as the time interval as . Thus the container was safe between minutes and minutes.   "

We'd have to do some fraction subtraction, followed by some fraction division. In other words, we'd use fraction arithmetic, which is a bit more likely to lead to human error than whole number arithmetic.  An alternative is to multiply each side of the equation by a helpful number that clears  Fraction clearing denominators the denominator(s). In the above example, the helpful number would be : Somehow multiplying by cleared all of the fractions from the equation. We could solve this equation easily now. This section covers this technique, which generally makes it easier to solve linear equations and inequalities when fractions are present.   Alternative Video Lessons      Eliminating Denominators     Deshawn planted a sapling in his yard that was 4 tall. The tree will grow of a foot every year. How many years will it take for his tree to become 10 tall?  We can use a table to help understand the rate of growth and then write a formula that models the tree's growth:       Years Passed  Tree's Height (ft)                             We find that years since the tree was planted, the tree's height is feet. To find when Deshawn's tree will be feet tall, we set up the equation Note that the equation has a fraction present as a coefficient.  To solve the equation, note that the fraction's denominator is . As the very first step, multiplying by on each side of the equation will leave us with no fractions.   Let's check the solution to be sure:   In summary, it will take years for Deshawn's tree to reach feet tall. The point of this example was to demonstrate how clearing denominators can make an equation relatively easier to solve.      In a science lab, a container had ounces of water at 9:00 AM. Water has been evaporating at the rate of ounces every minutes. When will there be ounces of water left?        Since the container has been losing oz of water every minutes, it loses oz every minute. At minutes past 9:00 AM, the container will have lost oz of water. Since the initial amount was oz, the amount of water in the container (in oz) can be modeled by  So to work out when there would be only oz of water left, we write the following equation. Note there is a denominator of which we can clear.   From here it is straightforward to use steps from Section 2 to solve the equation. You can try that on your own and you should find that it will take between and minutes for the container to only have ounces of water left.        The previous examples only had one fraction in the equation. What happens if there are more?    Solve for in .    Once again, we have an equation with fractions present. This time there are multiple denominators: , , and . Is there one number we could use to clear all three denominators? The Least Common Multiple of the denominators (abbreviated as LCM or LCD) would work. Anything that is a multiple of all three of these denominators would work, and using the smallest such number is just a good habit. In this case, the LCD is . So we will multiply each side of the equation by :      Checking the solution :    The solution is therefore and the solution set is .       Solve for in        With fractions present, we decide to identify the LCD. The denominators are and so the LCD is And so our first algebra step is to multiply each side of the equation by   Checking the solution   So the solution is and so the solution set is          Solve for in the equation .    There are two fractions appearing here, and both have the same denominator . We can multiply by on each side and that alone will clear the denominators.      Checking the solution :    The solution is therefore and the solution set is .      Solve for in the equation .    The structure of the equation is a little different from previous examples, but we can still see that there are denominators and , and that their LCM is . Multiplying each side of the equation by will help.      Checking the solution :    The solution is and the solution set is .      Proportional Equations  Proportional equations are used to solve many real-life applications where two quantities vary Proportions together. For example if you have more liquid Tylenol in a medicine cup, then you have more milligrams of the drug itself dissolved in that liquid. The two quantities (volume of liquid and mass of the drug) vary together.   Proportions applications of  Suppose we want to know the total cost for a box of cereal that weighs ounces, assuming it costs the same per ounce as a -ounce box. Letting be this unknown cost (in dollars), we could set up a proportional equation. Whether we are dealing with the smaller box or the larger box, the ratio of cost to weight is supposed to be the same. So below on the left, we enter details for the larger box. And on the right, for the smaller box. We can rewrite this equation without the units: And we have an equation with fractions present. We want to multiply each side by the LCD, but this time the denominators are larger than previous examples. Can we still find the LCD? We could! But it is maybe not worth the time and effort. Having the least common multiple is a nice thing, but any common multiple of denominators will work out for our needs. A simple way to get a common multiple is just to multiply the numbers together. So we choose to multiply each side by instead of whatever the actual LCD is. So assuming the cost is proportional to the cost of the -ounce box, the cost for an -ounce box of cereal would be .     Property taxes for a residential property are proportional to the assessed value of the property. A certain home is assessed at and its annual property taxes are . What are the annual property taxes for the house next door that is assessed at ?    Let be the annual property taxes (in dollars) for a property assessed at . We can write and solve this proportion: The least common denominator of this proportion is rather large, so we will instead multiply each side by and and simplify from there: The property taxes for a property assessed at are .       Infant Tylenol contains 160 mg of acetaminophen in each 5 mL of liquid. If Bao s baby is prescribed 60 mg of acetaminophen, how many milliliters of liquid should he give the baby?        Assume Bao should give milliliters of liquid medicine, so we can set up the following proportion:   So to give 60 mg of acetaminophen to his baby, Bao should measure out 1.875 mL of the liquid medication.          Tagging fish is a means of estimating the size of the population of fish in a lake. A sample of fish is taken, tagged, and then redistributed into the lake. Later when another sample is taken, some of those fish will have tags. The number of tagged fish are assumed to be proportional to the total number of fish. We can look at that relationship from the perspective of the entire lake, or just the second sample, and we get two ratios that should be proportional.   Assume that fish are caught and tagged. Once they are redistributed, a sample of fish is taken. Of these, are tagged. Estimate how many fish total are in the lake.    Let be the number of fish in the lake. We can set up a proportion for this scenario: To solve for , which is in a denominator, we'll need to multiply each side by both and : According to this sample, we can estimate that there are about fish in the lake.      Solving Inequalities with Fractions  The technique of clearing denominators also applies to inequalities, not just equations.    Solve for in the inequality . Write the solution set in both set-builder notation and interval notation.    The LCM of the denominators is , so we start out multiplying each side of the inequality by .   The solution set in set-builder notation is . And in interval notation, it's .       Solve for in the inequality Write the solution set in both set-builder notation and interval notation.             The LCM of the denominators is so we start out by multiplying each side of the inequality by   Note that when we divided each side of the inequality by the inequality symbol reversed direction. The solution set in set-builder notation is The solution set in interval notation is            What does LCD stand for? And using different words, explain what it is.

  "body": "   In a science lab, a container had ounces of water at 9:00 AM. Water has been evaporating at the rate of ounces every minutes. When will there be ounces of water left?        Since the container has been losing oz of water every minutes, it loses oz every minute. At minutes past 9:00 AM, the container will have lost oz of water. Since the initial amount was oz, the amount of water in the container (in oz) can be modeled by  So to work out when there would be only oz of water left, we write the following equation. Note there is a denominator of which we can clear.   From here it is straightforward to use steps from Section 2 to solve the equation. You can try that on your own and you should find that it will take between and minutes for the container to only have ounces of water left.       "

Letting be this unknown cost (in dollars), we could set up a proportional equation. Whether we are dealing with the smaller box or the larger box, the ratio of cost to weight is supposed to be the same. So below on the left, we enter details for the larger box. And on the right, for the smaller box. We can rewrite this equation without the units: And we have an equation with fractions present. We want to multiply each side by the LCD, but this time the denominators are larger than previous examples. Can we still find the LCD? We could! But it is maybe not worth the time and effort. Having the least common multiple is a nice thing, but any common multiple of denominators will work out for our needs. A simple way to get a common multiple is just to multiply the numbers together. So we choose to multiply each side by instead of whatever the actual LCD is. So assuming the cost is proportional to the cost of the -ounce box, the cost for an -ounce box of cereal would be .  "

  "title": "Special Solution Sets",
  "body": " Special Solution Sets   Most of the time after solving a linear equation in one variable, you end with a direct statement of what the variable must equal. For example, concludes with . There is only one solution, in this case.  Similarly, after solving a linear inequality, you typically end with a statement like , and the solution set is represented with either interval notation like , or with set-builder notation like . Visually on a number line, it is either the left half or the right half of the number line.   Occasionally you will have a linear equation or inequality that doesn't work this way. A linear equation might have many solutions, not just one. Or it might have none at all . An inequality might also have no solutions. Or maybe every number on the entire number line will be a solution. In this section we explore these kinds of equations and inequalities, where the solution set is special .   Alternative Video Lessons      Special Solution Sets  Recall that for the equation , there is only one number which will make the equation true: . This means that the solution is , and we write the solution set as . We say the equation's solution set has one element , .  We'll now explore equations where all real numbers are solutions, and other equations where no real number is a solution.   Linear equations with no solution  Solve for in .  To solve this equation, we need to move all terms containing to one side of the equal sign. We set out to remove the from the right side of the equation, by subtracting from each side:   But now is no longer present in the equation. Our effort to remove from Empty set the right side coincidentally removed it from the left side too. What value can we substitute in for to make become true? That's a trick question; you could never make become true. We say this equation has no solution . Or we say that the equation has an empty solution set . We can write an empty solution set as , or . (Be careful notto confuse the empty set symbol with the number zero, .)  The equation isunambiguously false no matter what might be. This shows us there is no solution to the original equation.    Linear equations with infinitely many solutions  Solve for in .  We will move all terms containing to one side of the equal sign:   Once again, is no longer present in the equation. What value can we substitute in for to make be true? This is another trick question; any value for would work. This means that all real numbers are solutions to the equation . We say this equation's solution set contains all real numbers . We can write this set using interval notation as , or use as an abbreviation for the set of all real numbers.  The equation isunambiguously true no matter what might be. This shows us that all real numbers are solutions to the original linear equation.    What would have happened if we had continued the solving process after we obtained in Example ? All we found was another unambiguously true equation, and we still conclude that all real numbers are solutions.    Note that there is a very important difference when our process ends with , compared to when it ends with . The first equation is true for all values that might have, and the solution set is . The second situation has only one solution, , and the solution set is .    Inequalities with infinitely many solutions  Solve for in the inequality .  To solve for , we aim to eliminate that on the right side by subtracting from each side: We again find ourselves with the variable completely eliminated from both sides. What values of would make the inequality true? The answer is that all values of make , which we know is a strange sounding sentence. So our solution set is all real numbers, which we can write as or .    Inequalities with no solutions  Solve for in the inequality .  To solve for , we aim to eliminate the from the right side by adding to each side: And yet again, the variable has gone missing. We can ask ourselves, For which values of is true? The answer is that this is impossible. There is no solution to this inequality. We can write the solution set using or just say that there are no solutions .   Let's summarize these two special cases that sometimes arise when solving linear equations and inequalities.   Special Solution Sets for Equations and Inequalities    All Real Numbers  When solving an equation or inequality boils down to an unambiguously true equation or inequality such as or , then all real numbers are solutions. We write this solution set as or .    No Solution  When solving an equation or inequality boils down to an outright false statement such as or , then no real number is a solution. We write this solution set as either or or write in words something like there are no solutions .       Further Examples  These examples may have no solutions or all real numbers as the solution set. Each example calls back to the fundamental steps for solving linear equations and inequalities that we learned in , , and .     Solve for in        We recall the technique from Section 4 where we clear denominators by multiplying each side of the equation by the least common denominator. Here, we will multiply each side by After that, we ll be able to simplify each side of the equation and continue:   The statement is unambiguously false, so the equation has no solution.           Solve for in the equation        A lot could be simplified on each side before continuing, by distributing and combining like terms.   From here, we subtract from each side:   As the equation is outright false, there is no solution to this equation.           Solve for in the inequality        We start by multiplying each side of the inequality by the LCD, which is Then we can continue:   As the equation is true for all values of all real numbers are solutions to the original inequality. So the solution set is or just            With a linear equation in one variable, what are the possibilities for how many solutions it could have? One solution? Two solutions? Are there other possibilities?       How will you know when a linear equation or inequality has no solution?       How will you know when all numbers are solutions to a linear equation or inequality?        Notation     What is one valid way to communicate that there are no solutions to an equation?

  "body": " Isolating a Linear Variable   In this section, we solve for a variable in a linear equation even when there are other Variable isolating variables present. The process is not really new, but there is a little more abstraction as Variable solving for in a formula we track those other variables through each step.   Alternative Video Lessons      Solving for a Variable   The formula of calculating a rectangle's area is , where stands for the rectangle's length and stands for its width. When a rectangle's length and width are given, this formula lets us calculate the rectangle's area.       What if we know a rectangle's area and length , but we need to calculate its width?      Well, if a rectangle's area is  12  , and its length is  4  , we could substitute these values into the area formula and then we have only one variable left, , and we can solve for it:   We can go through the same steps without using specific numbers for and :   Now we have an equation where is isolated. For example if we want to find the width when and , we have a formula: . This formula can be used again: what if and ? Or if and ? This formula, , is a handy alternative to the original formula for situations where is the unknown value.  Note that when solving for , we divided each side of the equation by . Why exactly? We were trying to isolate , and was being multiplied by . It's key to understand that we applied the opposite action (dividing by ) to what was happening to our target variable (it was being multiplied by ). We will think in terms of un-doing actions as we continue.   Solve for in . (This is the relationship in economics between profit, revenue, and cost.)  To solve for , we notice what is happening to in this equation: is subtracted from . To undo this, we add  to each side. As we track our steps below, we'll emphasize which variable it is that we are trying to isolate. With more than one variable here, it can be easy to lose track of which one you are trying to solve for. In other words, revenue is the sum of profit and cost.     Solve for in . (This is a line's equation in slope-intercept form, which we study thoroughly in Section .)    In the equation , we see that is multiplied by and then is added to that. Think of as a birthday present, enclosed in a box, and then placed in a gift bag. To get your gift, you need to undo those containers in the opposite order: take it out of the bag, then open the box. We need to undo multiplying by and adding in the opposite order. So we will start by subtracting : And then dividing by :      In Example , each side was divided by . It's not uncommon for students to have and write something like , but this is incorrect. If you are going to divide by something as a step in the process, you will need to divide the two sides of the equation.     Solve for in . (This is the area formula for a triangle.)    As we studied in , when an equation has fractions, a helpful first step is to clear denominators. So here we will multiply by on each side. Now our target variable is being multiplied by , so we apply the opposite action, dividing by :        Solve for in        To solve for we first isolate by subtracting from each side of the equation. After that, we can divide each side by to finish solving for           Solve for in . (This represents the relationship between temperature in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit.)    There is more than one way to do this, but we will follow the guidance that we've already developed in this textbook. Our first step will be to clear the denominator: Now what is happening to our target variable ? It has subtracted from it, and then that result is multiplied by . So we will do the opposite actions in the opposite order: divide by and then add .         Suppose you want to solve the equation for . What would be wrong with dividing on each side by to get ?       How do you undo dividing something by ?       What is one reason why we might take a formula like and find it useful to solve for and write ?

  "body": " Exploring Two-Variable Data and Rate of Change   This section is about making observations about data and the patterns that you might see. In some cases, we are able to turn those observations into useful mathematical calculations.   Alternative Video Lesson      Modeling data with two variables  Math helps us understand data from the world around us. We can use what we discover to understand the world better and make better decisions. Here's an example with economic data from the US, plotted in a Cartesian plane.  For the years from 2000 to 2021, consider what percent of American wealth was held by the wealthiest 1% of Americans. The table in gives the numbers (source: ), but any pattern there might not be apparent when looking at the data organized this way. Plotting the data in a Cartesian coordinates system can make an overall pattern or trend become visible.   Share of all income held by the top 1% of wage earners         year %  year %    2000 28.5  2011 29.4    2001 27  2012 29.5    2002 26  2013 30.2    2003 25  2014 30.5    2004 27.3  2015 31.1    2005 27.7  2016 31.2    2006 28.7  2017 31    2007 29  2018 31    2008 29.1  2019 30.9    2009 27  2020 30.2    2010 28.4  2021 32.1     a scatter plot about share of all wealth held by the top 1% in the US      What observations do you see now that you couldn't easily see from the numbers in the table? Do you see evidence of the COVID pandemic? Evidence of the Great Recession of 2008?  Overall, do you see a larger pattern with wealth distribution? Assuming that you see the rising pattern, is it easier to see that with the graph than with the table?    Patterns in Tables    Find a pattern in each table, using only the table itself. What is the missing entry in each table? Can you describe each pattern in words and\/or mathematics?   Patterns in 3 tables       black  white    big  small    short  tall    few         USA  Washington    UK  London    France  Paris    Mexico         1  2    2  4    3  6    5            First table  Each word on the right has the opposite meaning of the word to its left.

The first table assigns  white to black , as its opposite. The second table assigns  Paris to France , as its capital city. The third table assigns  to , as its double.    The third table in is numerical. And its function is to take a number as input, and give twice that number as output. Mathematically, we can describe the pattern as , where represents the input and represents the output. Labeling the table mathematically, we have .  The equation summarizes the pattern in the table.    Table with a mathematical pattern        (input)    (output)                        Pattern:      Only the third table in is a table of numbers. Let's examine that data graphically.   The data from the third table in           With the data plotted, and the question being what should happen when is , our eyes can converge to the point and we conclude the missing value will be . Graphically, we didn't have to use the observation that the -values were twice the -values.  For each of the following tables, find an equation that describes the pattern you see. Numerical pattern recognition may or may not come naturally for you and you may want to use a graph to help visually process the numbers. Either way, pattern recognition is an important mathematical skill that anyone can develop. The solutions for these exercises offer some hints about what patterns you might look for.     Write an equation in the form suggested by the pattern in the table.                                 One approach to pattern recognition is to look for a relationship in each row. Here, the -value in each row is always more than the -value. So the pattern is described by the equation           Write an equation in the form suggested by the pattern in the table.                                 The relationship between and in each row is not as clear here. Another popular approach for finding patterns: in each column, consider how the values change from one row to the next. From row to row, the -value increases by Also, the -value increases by from row to row.               (add from previous)  (add from previous)    (add from previous)  (add from previous)    (add from previous)  (add from previous)    Since row-to-row change is always for and is always for the rate of change from one row to another row is always the same: units of for every unit of This suggests that  might be a good equation for the table pattern. But if we try to make a table with that pattern:          Actual value of                        We find that the values from are too large by So now we make an adjustment. The equation describes the pattern in the table.           Write an equation in the form suggested by the pattern in the table.                                 Looking for a relationship in each row here, we see that each -value is the square of the corresponding -value. That may not be obvious to you. It comes down to recognizing what square numbers are. So the equation is  What if we had tried the approach we used in the previous exercise, comparing change from row to row in each column?               (add from previous)  (add from previous)    (add from previous)  (add from previous)    (add from previous)  (add from previous)    Here, the rate of change is not constant from one row to the next. While the -values are increasing by from row to row, the -values increase more and more from row to row. Do you notice that there is a pattern there as well? Mathematicians are interested in finding patterns and describing them.          Rate of Change  Rate of change  For an hourly wage-earner, the amount of money they earn depends on how many hours they work. If a worker earns per hour, then hours of work corresponds to of pay. Working one additional hour will change hours to hours; and this will cause the in pay to rise by fifteen dollars to in pay. Any time we compare how one amount changes (dollars earned) as a consequence of another amount changing (hours worked), we are talking about a rate of change .  Given a table of two-variable data, between any two rows we can compute a rate of change .   The following data, given in both table and graphed form, gives the counts of invasive cancer diagnoses in Oregon over a period of time. ( )          Year   Invasive Cancer  Incidents   Year   Invasive Cancer  Incidents   Year   Invasive Cancer  Incidents    2000 17,458 2007 19,430 2014 21,686  2001 17,862 2008 20,459 2015 22,154  2002 17,879 2009 20,007 2016 22,128  2003 17,590 2010 19,887 2017 23,011  2004 18,497 2011 20,867 2018 22,640  2005 18,732 2012 20,448 2019 23,755  2006 19,161 2013 21,354 2020 20,151       Note the severe drop in 2020 is probably explained by under-diagnosing, when people were in quarantine at home and it was difficult to see a doctor for things like a cancer screening.  What was the rate of change in Oregon invasive cancer diagnoses between 2000 and 2010? The total (net) change in diagnoses over that timespan is meaning that there were more invasive cancer incidents in 2010 than in 2000. Since years passed (which you can calculate as ), the rate of change is diagnoses per years, or We read that last quantity as diagnoses per year . This rate of change means that between the years and , there were more diagnoses each year, on average. This is just an average over those ten years it does not mean that the diagnoses grew by exactly this much each year.       Use the data in Example 11 to find the rate of change in Oregon invasive cancer diagnoses between 2000 and 2003.        To find the rate of change between 2000 and 2003, calculate   So the rate of change was     And what was the rate of change between 2015 and 2020?        To find the rate of change between 2005 and 2020, calculate   So the rate of change was         We are ready to give a formal definition for rate of change . Considering our work from and , we settle on:   Rate of Change  Rate of change   If and are two data points from a set of two-variable data, then the rate of change between them is . The Greek letter delta, , is used to represent change in since it is the first letter of the Greek word for difference .    In and we found three rates of change. highlights the three pairs of points that were used to make these calculations.         Note how the larger the numerical rate of change between two points, the steeper the line is that connects them. Also when the -values went down as you read the graph left-to-right, the rate of change was negative. This is such an important observation, we'll put it in an official remark.   The rate of change between two data points is related to the steepness of the line segment that connects those points.   The steeper the line, the larger the rate of change, and vice versa.    If one rate of change between two data points equals another rate of change between two different data points, then the corresponding line segments will have the same steepness.    We always measure rate of change from left to right. When a line segment between two data points slants up from left to right, the rate of change between those points will be positive. When a line segment between two data points slants down from left to right, the rate of change between those points will be negative.       In the solution to , the key observation was that the rate of change from one row to the next was constant: units of increase in for every unit of increase in . Graphing this pattern in , we see that every line segment here has the same steepness, so the whole picture is a straight line.          Whenever the rate of change is constant no matter which two -pairs (or data pairs) are chosen from a data set, then you can conclude the graph will be a straight line even without making the graph . We call this kind of relationship a linear  Linear relationship relationship. We'll study linear relationships in more detail throughout this chapter. Right Relationship linear now in this section, we feel it is important to simply identify if data has a linear relationship or not.     Is there a linear relationship in the table?                            The relationship is linear   The relationship is not linear         From one -value to the next, the change is always From one -value to the next, the change is always So the rate of change is always Since the rate of change is constant, the data have a linear relationship.           Is there a linear relationship in the table?                            The relationship is linear   The relationship is not linear         The rate of change between the first two points is The rate of change between the last two points is This is one way to demonstrate that the rate of change differs for different pairs of points, so this pattern is not linear.           Is there a linear relationship in the table?                            The relationship is linear   The relationship is not linear         The changes in from one row to the next are and That s not a consistent pattern, but we need to consider rates of change between points. The rate of change between the first two points is The rate of change between the next two points is And the rate of change between the last two points is So the rate of change, is constant regardless of which pairs we choose. That means these pairs describe a linear relationship.        Let's return to the data that we opened the section with, in . Is that data linear? Well, yes and no. To be completely honest, it's not linear. It's easy to pick out pairs of points where the steepness changes from one pair to the next. In other words, the points do not line up into a single straight line.  However if we step back, there does seem to be an overall upward trend that is captured by the line overlaying the data in . Points on the overlaid line do have a linear pattern. Let's estimate the rate of change between some pair of points on this line. We are free to use any pair of points to do this, so let's make this calculation easier by choosing points we can clearly identify on the graph: and .   Share of all income held by the top 1%, United States, 2000 2021   a scatter plot about share of all income held by the top 1% in the US     The rate of change between those two points is So we might say that on average , the rate of change expressed by this data is percentage points per year.      Given a table of data with - and -values, explain how to calculate the rate of change from one row to the next.      If there is a table of data with - and -values, and the plot of all that data makes a straight line, what is true about the rates of change as you move from row to row in the table?      What does it mean for a rate of change to be positive versus negative?       Skills Practice   Finding Patterns   Write an equation in the form suggested by the pattern in the table.                                         Each -value is times what the corresponding -value is. So the equation is                                              Each -value is times what the corresponding -value is.

To find the rate of change between 2001 and 2009, calculate      And what was the rate of change between 2012 and 2016?        To find the rate of change between 2012 and 2016, calculate      List all the year-long intervals where there is a negative rate of change.        The rate of change is negative for the years starting in 2003, 2019, and 2020, and no other years. These are the only years in the data table where the population goes down the next year. So the intervals are [2003], [2019], [2020], [2021].     Over which decade was the rate of change highest?        The steepest rate of change over a ten-year period was from 2006 to 2016. To find this, calculate each of the rates of change from 2000 to 2010, from 2001 to 2011, and so on. Although looking at the graph, you can see that some rates of change are not as steep as others and narrow down the search.       What was that rate of change?        Between 2006 and 2016:             This table gives the tide level in Lincoln City, Oregon, over one particular 24-hour period, measured in feet above average sea level.

To find the rate of change between hours 2 and 6, calculate      And what was the rate of change between hours 12 and 17?        To find the rate of change between hours 12 and 17, calculate      List the longest intervals where there is a negative rate of change without any times in between that have positive rates of change.        The rate of change is negative from hour 0 to hour 6, and again from hour 12 to hour 18. So the intervals are [0,6], [12,18].     Over which hour-long interval was the rate of change highest?        The steepest rate of change happens from hour 21 to hour 22. To find this, we can calculate each of the rates of change from one hour to the next, and the largest result happens from hour 21 to hour 22.     What was that rate of change?        Between hour 21 and 22:            "

The rate of change is negative for the years starting in 2003, 2019, and 2020, and no other years. These are the only years in the data table where the population goes down the next year. So the intervals are [2003], [2019], [2020], [2021].     Over which decade was the rate of change highest?        The steepest rate of change over a ten-year period was from 2006 to 2016. To find this, calculate each of the rates of change from 2000 to 2010, from 2001 to 2011, and so on. Although looking at the graph, you can see that some rates of change are not as steep as others and narrow down the search.       What was that rate of change?        Between 2006 and 2016:         "

  "body": " Slope   In Section , we saw that a steady, constant rate of change between points means there is a linear relationship between and . A steady, constant rate of change has a special name, slope , and we'll explore slope more in this section.   Alternative Video Lesson      What is slope?    Given a graph with points plotted, when the rate of change from one point to the next one never changes, those points must all be on a straight line as in . Instead of saying steady, constant rate of change , there is a special word for this.    Between successive points, the rate of change is always .         Slope  Slope  Slope definition   When and are two variables where the rate of change between any two Slope as rate of change points is the same no matter which two points are used, we call this common rate of change the slope . Since having a constant rate of change means the graph will be a Slope of a line straight line, it's also called the slope of the line . Lines slope of     Considering the definition for rate of change , this means that when and are two variables where the rate of change between two points is always the same, then you can calculate slope, , by finding two distinct data points and , and calculating .   Slope  Why is the letter used as the symbol for slope ? Some believe that it comes from the French word monter which means to climb .   A slope is a rate of change. So if there are units for the horizontal and vertical variables, then there will be units for the slope. The slope will be measured in . If the slope is nonzero, we say Linear relationship that there is a linear relationship between and . When the slope Relationship linear is , we say that is constant with respect to . Relationship constant   Here are some scenarios with different slopes. As you read each scenario, note how a slope is more meaningful with units.   If a tree grows feet every year, its rate of change in height is the same from year to year. So the height and time have a linear relationship where the slope is  2.5  .    If a company loses million dollars every year, its rate of change in reserve funds is the same from year to year. So the company's reserve funds and time have a linear relationship where the slope is million dollars per year.    If Sakura is an adult who has stopped growing, her rate of change in height is the same from year to year it's zero. So the slope is  0  . Sakura's height is constant with respect to time. Since the slope is zero, we don't say that Sakura's height and time have a linear relationship.      A useful phrase for remembering the definition of slope is rise over run . Here, Rise over run  rise refers to change in , and run refers to change in . Be careful. As mentioned earlier, in mathematics the horizontal direction comes first . The phrase rise over run might make it sound like the vertical direction comes first, but that is misleading. (It's a bit awkward to say, but the phrase run under rise puts the horizontal change first.)    Yara's Savings  On Dec. 31, Yara had only in her savings account. For the the new year, she resolved to deposit into her savings account each week, without withdrawing any money from the account. Yara keeps her resolution, and her account balance increases steadily by each week. That's a constant rate of change, so her account balance has a linear relationship with time, and the slope is .  We can model the balance, (measured in dollars) in Yara's savings account weeks after she started making deposits with an equation. Since Yara started with and adds each week, then weeks after she started making deposits, where is a dollar amount. Notice that the slope, , is used as the multiplier for , the number of weeks that have passed.  We can also examine Yara's savings using a table as in .   Yara's savings          , weeks  since Dec. 31   , savings account  balance (dollars)           increases by    increases by    increases by    increases by    increases by    increases by    increases by    increases by    increases by    increases by     In first rows of the table, we see that when increases by (week), then increases by (dollars). The row-to-row rate of change is , which we already know is the slope. In any table showing a linear relationship, whenever increases by unit, will increase by the slope.  In later rows, notice that the change in is larger than , but the change in is also larger than . The changes in have grown proportionally with the changes in and this keeps the rate of change steady. Looking in particular at the last two rows of the table, we see increases by and increases by , which gives a rate of change , which is once again the value of the slope.  On a graph of Yara's savings, we can see the rates of change between consecutive rows of the table by using slope triangles . These are right triangles showing how to Slope triangle move horizontally, then vertically, to get from one point to another.    Yara's savings        The large slope triangle indicates that when weeks pass, Yara saves . This is the rate of change between the last two rows of the table, . The smaller slope triangles indicate, from left to right, the rates of change , , , and respectively. All of these rates simplify to the slope, .    Every slope triangle on the graph of Yara's savings has the same angles even though some are larger than others. Since the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change is always . On any graph of any sloped line, we can draw a slope triangle and compute slope as rise over run .    Slope Triangles Above   Of course, we could draw a slope triangle on the top side of a line. This slope triangle works just as well for identifying rise and run , but it emphasizes vertical change before horizontal change. For consistency with mathematical conventions, we will usually draw slope triangles that show the horizontal change first, followed by the vertical change, as in .   Yara's savings           The following graph of a line models the amount of gas, in gallons, in Kiran's gas tank as they drive their car. Find the line's slope, and interpret its meaning in this context.   Amount of gas in Kiran's gas tank   This is a grid with a line, passing the points (3,8),(6,6),(9,4)...       To find a line's slope using its graph, we first identify two points on it and then draw a slope triangle. Naturally, we would want to choose two points whose - and -coordinates are easy to identify exactly based on the graph. We choose the two points where and , because they are right on grid line crossings:    A Good Slope Triangle   This is a grid with a line, passing the points (3,8),(6,6),(9,4)...There is a slope triangle starting from (3,8), passing (6,8) and ending at (6,6). The label from (3,8) to (6,8) is \"3 hours\"; and the label from (6,8) to (6,6) is \"-2 gallons\".     Notice that the change in is negative, because the amount of gas is decreasing. Since we chose points with integer coordinates, we can easily calculate the slope: . In the given context, this slope implies gas in the tank is decreasing at the rate of    . Since this slope is written as a fraction, another way to understand it is that Kiran is using gallons of gas every hours.        Find the slope of the line.     To find the slope of a line from its graph, we first need to identify two points that the line passes through. It is wise to choose points with integer coordinates. For this problem, we choose and  Next, we sketch a slope triangle and find the rise and run . In the sketch below, the rise is and the run is     This line s slope is           Make a table and plot the equation which makes a straight line. Use the plot to determine the slope of this line.        First, we choose some -values to make a table, and compute the corresponding -values.          Point                                            This table lets us plot the graph and identify a slope triangle that is easy to work with.    Since the slope triangle runs units and then rises units, the slope is          Comparing Slopes  It's useful to understand when more than one line having different slopes appear on the same coordinate system.   Effie, Ivan and Cleo are in a foot race. models the distance each has traveled in the first few seconds. Each runner takes a second to accelerate up to their running speed, but then runs at a constant speed. So they are then traveling with a constant rate of change, and the straight line portions of their graphs have a slope. Find each line's slope, and interpret its meaning in this context. What comparisons can you make with these runners?   A three-way foot race       We will draw slope triangles to find each line's slope.   Find the Slope of Each Line                 Using the slope equation , we have:   Effie's slope is .    Ivan's slope is .    Cleo's slope is .     In a distance-over-time graph, the slope of a line represents speed. The slopes in these examples and the running speeds of these runners are measured in   . A relationship we can see is that the more steeply a line is slanted, the larger the slope is. This should make sense because for each passing second, the faster runner travels farther, making a slope triangle's height taller. This means that we can tell that Cleo is the fastest runner (and Effie is the slowest) just by comparing the slopes .    Jogging on Mt. Hood    Kato is training for a race up the slope of Mt. Hood, from Sandy to Government Camp, and then back. The graph models his elevation from his starting point as time passes. Find the slopes of the three line segments and interpret their meanings in this context.      What is the slope of the first segment?        The first segment started at and stopped at This implies Kato started at the starting point, traveled hours and reached a point feet higher in elevation from the starting point. The slope of the line is   In context, Kato was gaining feet in elevation per hour.     What is the slope of the second segment?        What happened in the second segment, which started at and ended at This implies he started this portion feet high, and didn t change elevation for hours. Maybe some of that time he was running at a constant elevation, and some of that time he was resting.   In context, Kato was running but neither gaining nor losing elevation.     What is the slope of the third segment?        The third segment started at and stopped at This implies Kato started this part of his trip from feet high, traveled for hours, and returned to the starting elevation. The slope of the line is   In context, Kato was dropping in elevation by feet per hour.         Some important properties are demonstrated in .   The Relationship Between Slope and Increase\/Decrease  In a linear relationship, as the -value increases (in other words as you read its graph from left to right):  if the -values increase (in other words, the line goes upward), its slope is Positive slope positive. Slope positive   if the -values decrease (in other words, the line goes downward), its slope is Negative slope negative. Slope negative   if the -values don't change (in other words, the line is flat, or horizontal), Zero slope its slope is . Slope zero      These properties are summarized graphically in .      Positive slope        Negative slope        Zero slope           Finding Slope by Two Given Points  Several times in this section we computed a slope by drawing a slope triangle. That's not necessary if you already have coordinates for two points on a line. In fact, sometimes it's not practical to draw a slope triangle. (For instance if you only have specific information about two points that are too close together to draw a triangle, or if you cannot clearly see precise coordinates where you might start and stop your slope triangle.) Here we will show how to find a line's slope without drawing a slope triangle.   Your neighbor planted a sapling from a local nursery in his front yard several years ago. Ever since then, it has been growing at a constant rate. By the end of the third year, the tree was  15  tall. By the end of the sixth year, the tree was  27  tall. What's the tree's rate of growth ( the slope)?  We could sketch a graph for this scenario, and include a slope triangle. If we did that, it would look like:    Height of a Tree   This is a grid with a line, passing the points (3,15) and (6,27). A slope triangle is drawn, starting at (3,15), passing (6,15), and ends at (6,27). The label from (3,15) to (6,15) is \"6-3=3 years\"; the label from (6,15) to (6,27) is \"27-15=12 feet\".     By the slope triangle and we have: So the tree is growing at a rate of  4     But hold on. Did we really need this picture? The rise of came from a subtraction of two -values: . And the run of came from a subtraction of two -values: .  Here is a picture-free approach. We know that after  3  , the height is  15  . As an ordered pair, that information gives us the point which we can label as . Similarly, the background information tells us to consider , which we label as . Here, and represent the first point's - and -values, and and represent the second point's - and -values.  Now we can write an alternative to : This is known as the slope formula . The following graphs help to understand why Slope formula this formula works. Basically, we are still using a slope triangle to calculate the slope.   Understanding the slope formula    This is a grid with a line, passing the points (3,15) and (6,27). A slope triangle is drawn, starting at (3,15), passing (6,15), and ends at (6,27). The label from (3,15) to (6,15) is \"6-3=3 years\"; the label from (6,15) to (6,27) is \"27-15=12 feet\".     This is a grid with a line, passing the points (3,15) and (6,27). A slope triangle is drawn, starting at (3,15), passing (6,15), and ends at (6,27). The label from (3,15) to (6,15) is \"x2-x1\"; the label from (6,15) to (6,27) is \"y2-y1\".        It's important to use subscript instead of superscript in the slope equation, because means to take the number and square it. When we use , we are saying there are at least two -values in the conversation, and is the second of them.   The beauty of the slope formula is that to find a line's slope, we don't need to draw a slope triangle. Let's look at an example.    A line passes the points and . Find this line's slope.    If you are new to this formula, it may help to label each number before using the formula. The two given points are: Now apply the slope formula :   Note that we used parentheses when substituting negative numbers in and . This is a good habit to protect yourself from making errors with subtraction and double negatives.       A line passes through the points and Find this line s slope.        To find a line s slope, we can use the slope formula:   First, we mark which number corresponds to which variable in the formula:   Now we substitute these numbers into the corresponding variables in the slope formula:   So the line s slope is            Have you memorized a formula for finding the slope between two points using their coordinates?      What is an important thing to do with slope to make it more meaningful in an application problem?      Drawing a slope triangle can be helpful to think about slope. But what might happen that could make it impractical to draw a slope triangle?       Skills Practice   Slope from Coordinates   Find the slope of the line passing through the two given points.      and                  and                  and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and                and               Slope from a Graph   Find the slope of the line given its graph.

In a distance-over-time graph, the slope of a line represents speed. The slopes in these examples and the running speeds of these runners are measured in   . A relationship we can see is that the more steeply a line is slanted, the larger the slope is. This should make sense because for each passing second, the faster runner travels farther, making a slope triangle's height taller. This means that we can tell that Cleo is the fastest runner (and Effie is the slowest) just by comparing the slopes .  "

By the end of the third year, the tree was  15  tall. By the end of the sixth year, the tree was  27  tall. What's the tree's rate of growth ( the slope)?  We could sketch a graph for this scenario, and include a slope triangle. If we did that, it would look like:    Height of a Tree   This is a grid with a line, passing the points (3,15) and (6,27). A slope triangle is drawn, starting at (3,15), passing (6,15), and ends at (6,27). The label from (3,15) to (6,15) is \"6-3=3 years\"; the label from (6,15) to (6,27) is \"27-15=12 feet\".

And the run of came from a subtraction of two -values: .  Here is a picture-free approach. We know that after  3  , the height is  15  . As an ordered pair, that information gives us the point which we can label as . Similarly, the background information tells us to consider , which we label as . Here, and represent the first point's - and -values, and and represent the second point's - and -values.  Now we can write an alternative to : This is known as the slope formula .

  "body": " Slope-Intercept Form   In this section, we will explore the most common way to write the equation of a line. It's known as slope-intercept form .   Alternative Video Lesson      Slope-Intercept Definition  Recall , where Yara started with in her savings account, and from then on deposited each week. In that example, we used to represent how many weeks have passed. After weeks, Yara has added dollars. Since she started with , she now has . In this example, there is a constant rate of change of dollars per week, so we call that the slope. We also saw in that plotting Yara's balance over time makes a straight-line graph.  The graph of Yara's savings has some things in common with almost every straight-line graph. There is a slope, and there is a place where the line crosses the -axis. illustrates this in the abstract.    Yara's savings        Graphing lines in slope-intercept form  Generic line  Slope-intercept form graphing lines in   a coordinate plane with the line y=20x+50; the line extends to the left and the right      We already have a symbol, , for the slope of a line. That other feature, where the line crosses the -intercept is of interest to us now. The -intercept of a line is a point where the line crosses the -intercept  -axis. Since it's on the -axis, the -coordinate of this point is Intercept  . It is standard to call the point the -intercept, and call the number the -coordinate of the -intercept . It is almost inevitable that people will find this too wordy, and will call the -intercept. But technically, the -intercept is .    Use to answer this question.     What was the value of in the plot of Yara s savings?  What is the -intercept?             The line crosses the -axis at so the value of is And the -intercept is        One way to write the equation for Yara's savings was where and are immediately visible in the equation. Now we generalize this.   Slope-Intercept Form  Slope-intercept form  Equation of a line slope-intercept form   When and have a linear relationship where is the slope and is the -intercept, one equation for this relationship is and this equation is called the slope-intercept form of the line. It is called this because the slope and -intercept are immediately discernible from the numbers in the equation.       What are the slope and -intercept for each of the following line equations?        Equation  Slope  -intercept                                                                                                                            In the first three equations, simply read the slope according to slope-intercept form. The slopes are  and  The fourth equation was written with the terms not in the slope-intercept form order. It could be written and then it is clear that its slope is In any case, the slope is the coefficient of  The fifth equation is also written with the terms not in the slope-intercept form order. Changing the order of the terms, it could be written but this still does not match the pattern of slope-intercept form. Considering how fraction multiplication works, So we can write this equation as and we see the slope is  The last two equations could be written and allowing us to read their slopes as and  For the -intercepts, remember that we are expected to answer using an ordered pair not just a single number We can simply read that the first two -intercepts are and  The third equation does not exactly match the slope-intercept form, until you view it as and then you can see that its -intercept is  With the fourth equation, after rewriting it as we can see that its -intercept is  We already explored rewriting the fifth equation as where we can see that its -intercept is  The last two equations could be written and allowing us to read their -intercepts as and  Alternatively, we know that -intercepts happen where and substituting into each equation gives you the -value of the -intercept.         The number is the -value when . Therefore it is common to refer to as the initial value or starting value of a linear relationship.      Graphing Slope-Intercept Equations   With a simple equation like , we can see that this is a line whose slope is and which has initial value . So starting at on the -axis, each time we increase the -value by , the -value increases by . With these basic observations, we can quickly produce a table and\/or a graph.                start on  -axis      initial  value      increase  by      increase  by      increase  by      increase  by      increase  by      increase  by      increase  by      increase  by      A Cartesian graph with the points plotted from the table; there is a line passing through the points and slope triangles drawn between each pair of points       The conversion formula for a Celsius temperature into Fahrenheit is . This appears to be in slope-intercept form, except that and are replaced with and . Suppose you are asked to graph this equation. How will you proceed? You could make a table of values as we did in but that takes time and effort. Since the equation is in slope-intercept form, there is a better way.  Since this equation is for converting a Celsius temperature to a Fahrenheit temperature, it makes sense to let be the horizontal axis variable and be the vertical axis variable. Note the slope is and the vertical intercept (here, the -intercept) is .   Set up the axes using an appropriate window and labels. Considering the freezing temperature of water ( Celsius or Fahrenheit), and the boiling temperature of water ( Celsius or Fahrenheit), it's reasonable to let run through at least to and run through at least to .    Plot the -intercept, which is at .    Starting at the -intercept, use slope triangles to reach the next point. Since our slope is , that suggests a run of and a rise of might work. But as indicates, such slope triangles are too tiny. You can actually use any fraction equivalent to to plot using the slope, as in , , , or which all reduce to . Given the size of our graph, we will use to plot points, where we will try a run of and a rise of .    Connect your points with a straight line, use arrowheads, and label the equation.

Graphing    Set up the axes in an appropriate window such that the -intercept will be visible, and any run and rise amounts we plan to use do not make slope triangles that are too big or too small.   a coordinate plane with a scale of 2 on the x-axis and 5 on the y-axis; the y-intercept of (0,10) is plotted      The slope is .

We need to be able to calculate the line's slope and see its -intercept.     Use the graph to write an equation of the line in slope-intercept form.          On the line, pick two points with easy-to-read integer coordinates so that we can calculate slope. It doesn t matter which two points we use; the slope will be the same.    With the slope and -intercept found, we can write the line s equation:            The boiling temperature of water depends on what the surrounding air pressure is. Scientists measured the boiling point of water under various amounts of pressure and plotted the results below. Then they added a line of best fit .    Write an equation for this line in slope-intercept form.        Do your best to identify two points on the line.    Estimating the -intercept to be at we have          Writing a Slope-Intercept Equation Given Two Points  Any two points uniquely determine a line. Once you identify two points, there is a process to find the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line that connects them.    Find the slope-intercept form of an equation for the line that passes through the points and .    Our goal is to write , with specific numbers for and . The first step is to find the slope, . To do this, recall the slope formula from . It says that if a line passes through the points and , then the slope is found by the formula . Applying this to our two points and , we see that the slope is: We are trying to write . Since we already found the slope, we know that we want to write but we need a specific number for . We happen to know that one point on this line is , which is on the -axis because its -value is . So is this line's -intercept, and therefore . So our equation is .      Find the slope-intercept form of an equation for the line that passes through the points and .    We first find the slope between our two points: and . Using the slope formula again, we have:   Now that we have the slope, we can write , or more simply: . Unlike in , we are not given the value of because neither of our two given points have an -value of . To find , remember that we have two points that we already know should make the equation true! This means we can substitute either point into the equation (for the and the ) and solve for . Let's arbitrarily choose to substitute in.   We conclude that the slope-intercept line equation is .       Find the slope-intercept form of an equation for the line that passes through the points and        We first find the slope between our two points: and Using the slope formula, we have:   Now we can write and to find we need look no further than one of the given points: The value of is So, the slope-intercept form of the line is           Find the slope-intercept form of an equation for the line that passes through the points and        First find the slope through our points: and   At this point we have Now we need to solve for since neither of the points given to us were the vertical intercept. To do this, we choose one of the two points and plug it into our equation. We choose   So we have          Modeling with Slope-Intercept Form  We can model many relationships using slope-intercept form, and then solve related questions using algebra. Here are a few examples.    Uber is a ride-sharing company. Its pricing in Portland factors in how much time and how many miles a trip takes. But if you assume that rides average out at a speed of  30  , then their pricing scheme boils down to a base of for the trip, plus per mile. Use a slope-intercept equation and algebra to answer these questions.   How much is the fare if a trip is miles long?    With available to you, how long of a trip can you afford?       The rate of change (slope) is per mile, and the starting value is . So the slope-intercept equation is . In this equation, stands for the number of miles in a trip, and stands for the amount of money to be charged.  If a trip is miles long, we substitute into the equation and we have: And the -mile ride will cost you about . (We say about , because this was all assuming you average  30  .)  Next, to find how long of a trip would cost , we substitute into the equation and solve for : So with you could afford a little more than a -mile trip.       In a certain wildlife reservation in Africa, there are approximately elephants. Sadly, the population has been decreasing by elephants per year. Use a slope-intercept equation and algebra to answer these questions.   If the trend continues, what would the elephant population be years from now?    If the trend continues, how many years will it be until the elephant population dwindles to               The rate of change (slope) is elephants per year. Notice that since we are losing elephants, the slope is a negative number. The starting value is elephants. So the slope-intercept equation is   In this equation, stands for a number of years into the future, and stands for the elephant population. To estimate the elephant population years later, we substitute in the equation with and we have:   So if the trend continues, there would be elephants on this reservation 15 years later.  Next, to find when the elephant population would decrease to we substitute in the equation with and solve for   So if the trend continues, years later, the elephant population would dwindle to            How does slope-intercept form get its name?       What are two phrases you can use for in a slope-intercept form line equation?       Explain the two basic steps to graphing a line when you have the equation in slope-intercept form.

  "body": " Point-Slope Form   In , we learned that a linear equation can be written in slope-intercept form. This section covers an alternative that is often more useful depending on the application: point-slope form .   Alternative Video Lesson      Point-Slope Motivation and Definition  Since 1990, the population of the United States has been growing by about million people per year. Also, back in 1990, the population was million. Since the rate of growth has been roughly constant, a linear model is appropriate. Let's write an equation to model this.  We consider using slope-intercept form , but we would need to know the -intercept, and nothing in the background tells us that. We'd need to know the population of the United States back in the year 0, before there even was a United States.  We could do some side work to calculate the -intercept, but let's try something else instead. Here are some things we know:   The slope equation for a line in general is .    The slope of our line is , or .    One point on the line is , because in 1990 , the population was million.     If we use the generic variables to represent a point somewhere on this line, then the rate of change from to must be . So . There is good reason to isolate in this equation, so we do that.   This is a good place to pause. We have isolated , and three meaningful numbers appear in the equation: the rate of growth, a certain year, and the population in that year. This is a specific example of point-slope form . Before we look deeper at point-slope form, let's continue reducing the line equation into slope-intercept form by distributing and combining like terms.   One concern with slope-intercept form is that it uses the -intercept, which might have no meaning in the context of an application. For example, here we have found that the -intercept is at , but what practical use is that? It's nonsense to say that in the year 0, the population of the United States was million. It doesn't make sense to have a negative population. It doesn't make sense to talk about the United States population before there even was a United States. And it doesn't make sense to use this model for years earlier than 1990 because the background information says clearly that the rate of change we have applies to years 1990 and later.  For all these reasons, we prefer to have the equation back when it was in the form: and we purposely do not distribute the slope.   Point-Slope Form  Point-slope form  Equation of a line point-slope form   When and have a linear relationship where is the slope and is some specific point that the line passes through, an equation for this relationship is and this equation is called the point-slope form of the line. It is called this because two important features are immediately visible from the numbers in the equation: the slope and one point on the line.           There is a subtraction sign and an addition sign in point-slope form , and you may have trouble remembering which is which. But remember that that the line is supposed to pass through . So substituting in for should leave equal to . And it does. For example, consider our example equation . Here, is and is . And: The subtraction is exactly where it needs to be to wipe out and leave you with . More generally:    Alternative Point-Slope Form  It is also common to define point-slope form as by subtracting from each side. If you learn about point-slope form from some other resource, you may come across this. We feel that the form will be more helpful with college algebra, statistics, and calculus.      Consider the line in this graph:      Identify a point visible on this line that has integer coordinates, and write it as an ordered pair.    What is the slope of the line?    Use point-slope form to write an equation for this line, making use of a point with integer coordinates.                      The visible points with integer coordinates are  and    Several slope triangles are visible where the run is and the rise is So the slope is    Using the point-slope equation is (You could use other points, like and get a different-looking equation like which simplifies to )          In , the solution explains that each of the following are acceptable equations for the same line: The first uses as a point on the line, and the second uses . Are those two equations really equivalent? Let's distribute and simplify each of them to get slope-intercept form . So, yes. It didn't matter which point we used to write a point-slope equation. We get different-looking equations that still represent the same line.  Point-slope form is preferable when we know a line's slope and a point on it, but we don't know the -intercept. We recognize that distributing the slope and combining like terms can always be used to find the line's slope-intercept form.     Plot the line with equation        We can see from the equation that is a point on the line. The first step in making a plot is to go to that point on the graph. We also see the slope is so from our launch point of we can move forward and up to find a second point on the line.           A spa chain has been losing customers at a roughly constant rate since the year 2018. In 2021, it had customers; in 2024, it had customers. Management estimated that the company will go out of business once its customer base decreases to . If this trend continues, when will the company close?  The given information tells us two points on the line: and . The slope formula will give us the slope. After labeling those two points as and , we have: And considering units, this means they are losing customers per year.  We could make an equation for this line using slope-intercept form, but then we would need to calculate the -intercept, which would correspond to the number of customers in year . We'd be working with numbers that have no real-world meaning.  For point-slope form, since we calculated the slope, we know at least this much: . Now we can pick one of those two given points, say , and get the equation . Note that all three numbers in this equation have meaning in the context of the spa chain. The tells us how many customers are leaving per year, the represents a year, and the tells us the number of customers in that year.  We're ready to answer the question about when the chain might go out of business. We need to substitute the given value of into the appropriate place in our equation. In order to substitute correctly, we must clearly understand what the variable represents including its units, and what the variable represents including its units. Write down those definitions first in any question you attempt to answer. It will save you time in the long run, and avoid frustration. Knowing the variable represents the number of customers in a given year allows one to understand that must be replaced with customers. Knowing the variable represents a year allows one to understand that will not be substituted, because we are trying to solve for what year something happens.   After substituting in the equation with , we will solve for , and find the answer we seek.           We find that the company is headed toward a collapse in 2030.   illustrates one line representing the spa's customer base, and another line representing the customer level that would cause the business to close. To make a graph of , we first marked the point and from there used the slope of .      If we go state by state and compare the Republican presidential candidate s 2012 vote share ( ) to the Republican presidential candidate s 2016 vote share ( ), we get the following graph (called a scatterplot , used in statistics) where a trendline has been superimposed.    Find a point-slope equation for this line. (Note that a slope-intercept equation would use the -intercept coordinate and that would not be meaningful in context, since no state had anywhere near zero percent Republican vote.)        We need to calculate slope first. And for that, we need to identify two points on the line. conveniently, the line appears to pass right through We have to take a second point somewhere, and seems like a reasonable roughly accurate choice. The slope equation gives us that   Using as the point, the point-slope equation would then be           Using Two Points to Build a Linear Equation  Since two points can determine a line's location, we can calculate a line's equation using just the coordinates from any two points it passes through.    A line passes through and . Find this line's equation in both point-slope and slope-intercept form.    We will use the slope formula to find the slope first. After labeling those two points as , we have:    The point-slope equation is . Next, we will use and substitute with and with , and we have:   Next, we will change the point-slope equation into slope-intercept form:         A line passes through and Find equations for this line using both point-slope and slope-intercept form.             First, use the slope formula to find the slope of this line:   The generic point-slope equation is We have found the slope, and we may use for So an equation in point-slope form is  To find a slope-intercept form equation, we can take the generic and substitute in the value of we found. Also, we know that should make the equation true. So we have   So the slope-intercept equation is Note that the slope-intercept equation has an unfriendly fraction, and the fact that this can happen is another reason to use the point-slope form whenever it is reasonable to do so.          Recognizing Point-Slope Form  We can tell a lot about a linear equation now that we have learned both slope-intercept form and point-slope form . For example, we can know that is in slope-intercept form because it looks like . It will graph as a line with slope and vertical intercept . Likewise, we know that the equation is in point-slope form because it looks like . It will graph as a line that has slope and will pass through the point .    For the equations below, state whether they are in slope-intercept form or point-slope form. Then identify the slope of the line and at least one point that the line will pass through.                             The equation is in slope-intercept form. The slope is and the vertical intercept is .    The equation is in point-slope form. The slope is and the line passes through the point .    The equation is almost in slope-intercept form. If we rearrange the right hand side to be , we can see that the slope is and the vertical intercept is .    The equation is in point-slope form. The slope is and the line passes through the point .          Consider the graph in .   Using the point-slope form of a line, find three different linear equations for the line shown in the graph. Three integer-valued points are shown for convenience.    Determine the slope-intercept form of the equation of this line.                  To write any of the equations representing this line in point-slope form, we must first find the slope of the line and we can use the slope formula to do so. We will arbitrarily choose and as the two points. Inputting these points into the slope formula yields: So the slope of the line is .  Next, we need to write an equation in point-slope form based on each point shown. Using the point , we have: (This simplifies to .)  The next point is . Using this point, we can write an equation for this line as:   Finally, we can also use the point to write an equation for this line: which can also be written as:     As is the vertical intercept, we can write the equation of this line in slope-intercept form as . It's important to note that each of the equations that were written in point-slope form simplify to this, making all four equations equivalent.           Explain why there are some situations where point-slope form is preferable to slope-intercept form.       There are basically two steps to convert a point-slope line equation into a slope-intercept line equation. What are they?

  "body": " Solving a System by Graphing   We have learned a few ways to graph one line in the plane. Now we will graph two lines simultaneously and use what we see to identify the solution set to a system of two linear equations in two variables .   Alternative Video Lesson      Systems of Two Linear Equations in Two Variables  There are times when two linear equations (each one having two variables the same two variables) are relevant to some situation at the same time. When this happens, we have a system of two equations in two variables which we can write this way (if the variables are and ): The large left brace indicates that this is a collection of two distinct equations, not one equation that was somehow changed with algebra into an equivalent equation. In the system above, , , , and are specific numbers, while and are the variables. The two line equations in the system above are both in slope-intercept form, but that is not required. Each line equation could be written in some other form and we would still call this a system of two equations in two variables.  Let's explore an example of how these things arise.   Mathematical models involving a system of linear equations  Fabiana and David are running at constant speeds in parallel lanes on a track. David starts out ahead of Fabiana, but Fabiana is running faster. We want to determine when Fabiana will catch up with David.  Suppose that Fabiana is running with a speed of . If she started out at position meters, then her position in meters after seconds is given by David is running more slowly, at only . But he had a head start, starting out at a position meters ahead of Fabiana. So David's position in meters after seconds is given by One of these equations represents Fabiana, and the other represents David. But imagine if you could find a point that worked as a solution to Fabiana's equation and also as a solution to David's equation. That would mean there is a moment in time ( seconds after the clock started) when Fabiana's position equals David's position. (Both runners would be meters from the starting point.) In other words, this would be the moment when Fabiana catches up to David.  So we consider the two equations together: We have a system of two equations in two variables. And if we can find a common solution to both equations, we have figured out something meaningful.   A solution to a system is an ordered pair that is a solution to both equations in the system. Of course the variables may be different letters they should be whatever two variables the equations are using.  In , there is a solution: . You can verify that it works for both equations. Could you find that ordered pair yourself? In this section and the ones that follow, we will learn some techniques for finding it yourself. In this case, the solution tells us that it takes 8 for Fabiana to catch up with David. And when she does, they are 18 from the starting point.  For future reference, we establish some formal definitions now.   System of Linear Equations  Systems of linear equations  Linear system of equations  Solution(s) of system of linear equations  Ordered pair as solution of linear system   A system of linear equations is any pairing of two (or more) linear equations. (But in this book we are only examining systems with two equations with two variables.) A solution to a system of linear equations is any point that is a solution to each of the equations in the system. The solution set to a system of linear equations is the collection of all solutions to the system. The solution set might be empty, might consist of one point only, or might have more.      Solving a System of Equations by Graphing  Graphing systems of linear equations  Systems of linear equations solved by graphing  If the two equations in a system are both easy to graph, it might happen that we can find the solution to a system by graphing them both on the same axis system.   Systems of linear equations applications  Mathematical models involving a system of linear equations  Let's return to Fabiana and David from . The system of equations was And each of these two lines is straightforward to graph.    Fabiana's line has vertical intercept at and slope . So we can plot it by starting at the origin and using slope triangles that move to the right, then up .  David's line has vertical intercept at and slope . So we can plot it by starting at and using slope triangles that move to the right, then up .    David and Fabiana's distances over time   a coordinate plane with a line for Fabiana and a line for David; Fabiana's line has a y-intercept of (0,0) and David's line has a y-intercept of (0,2); the lines cross at the point (8,18)      As we can see in , the two line equations cross at the point . Note that this means is a solution to Fabiana's equation and also to David's equation. So there is a moment in time ( 8 ) when both runners are at the same position ( 18 ). This means that is the solution to our system of linear equation. And it means that it takes Fabiana 8 to catch up to David.   The lesson of is that we can find a solution to a system by graphing both lines and identifying where they cross.    Determine the solution to the system of equations graphed in .   Graph of a System of Equations   a cartesian plot with two intersecting lines; one line has a y-intercept of -2 and a slope of -1\/4; the other line has a y-intercept of 5 and a slope of 2       The two lines intersect where and , so there is only one solution. It is the point . The solution set is .       Determine the solution to the system of equations graphed below.          The two lines intersect where and so the solution is the point        Now let's solve a system where we need to make the graph ourselves.   Solve the following system of equations by graphing:    Notice that each of these equations is written in slope-intercept form. The first equation, , has slope and -intercept . The second equation, , has slope and -intercept . We can use this information to graph both lines.   and .   a Cartesian grid with two intersecting lines; one line has a y-intercept of 4 and a slope of 1\/2; the other line has a y-intercept of -5 and a slope of -1      It appears that the two lines intersect where and , so the solution to the system of equations would be the point . However we should be careful. Maybe the lines are poorly drawn, or maybe they cross at a point close to that is too close for us to see. We should check that actually works as a solution to each of the original equations, since we have those equations. This verifies that is the solution, and we write the solution set as .      Solve the following system of equations by graphing.              Both equations are written in slope-intercept form. The first equation, has slope and -intercept The second equation, has slope and -intercept We can use this information to graph both lines.    a Cartesian grid with two intersecting lines; one line has a y-intercept of -5 and a slope of 2\/3; the other line has a y-intercept of 2 and a slope of -1\/2   It appears that the two lines intersect where and so the solution to the system of equations would be the point However we should check that actually works as a solution to each of the original equations.   This verifies that is the solution.           Solve the following system of equations by graphing. Note that the equations are in standard form. To review plotting a line equation that is in standard form, see [cross-reference to target(s) \"section-standard-form\" missing or not unique] .              Both of these equations are written in standard form. The first equation, has -intercept at and -intercept at The second equation, has -intercept at and -intercept at We can use this information to graph both lines.    a Cartesian grid with two intersecting lines; one line has a x-intercept of -12 and y-intercept of 4; the other line has x-intercept of -4 and y-intercept of -4   It appears that the two lines intersect where and so the solution to the system of equations would be the point However we should check that actually works as a solution to each of the original equations.   This verifies that is the solution.           Solve the following system of equations by graphing. Note that the equations are in point-slope form. To review plotting a line equation that is in point-slope form, see Section 10.              Both of these equations are written in point-slope form. The first equation, passes through and has slope The second equation, passes through and has slope We can use this information to graph both lines.    a Cartesian grid with two intersecting lines; one line passes through (2,1) with slope 3; the other line passes through (-1,-1) with slope -1\/2   It appears that the two lines intersect where and so the solution to the system of equations would be the point However we should check that actually works as a solution to each of the original equations.   This verifies that is the solution.         Systems of linear equations applications    A college has a north campus and a south campus. The north campus has thousand students, but enrollment has been declining by thousand students per year. The newer south campus has only thousand students, but enrollment has been increasing by thousand students per year. If these trends continue, in how many years would the two campuses have the same number of students?    Write two equations that form a system for this scenario.             The north campus has initial population and decreases with rate thousand students per year. So one equation is  The south campus has initial population and increases with rate thousand students per year. So the other equation is     Plot the two lines.        For plotting, it may be helpful to write the system with the decimals converted to fractions:     a Cartesian grid with two intersecting lines; one line passes through (0,16) with slope -0.8; the other line passes through (0,2) with slope 0.6; the lines cross at (10,8)      Based on the graph, how long will it be until the two campuses have the same number of students?  How many students will each campus have at that time?             The lines cross at So after years, each campus will have thousand students.           Special Systems of Equations  Systems of linear equations with no solution  Systems of linear equations with infinitely many solutions  When we studied linear equations in one variable, there were two special cases discussed in detail in . One of these special cases was like with the equation , where there simply is no solution at all. The solution set is empty. The other special case is like with the equation , where there are infinitely many solutions. When solving systems of two linear equations in two variables, we have similar special cases to consider.   Parallel Lines  Consider the graphs of two lines with the same slope, and .   Graphs of and   a coordinate grid with two parallel lines; one line has a y-intercept of -4 and the other has a y-intercept of 1; they both have a slope of 2     For the system of equations what would the solution be? Since the two lines have the same slope, they are parallel lines and they never cross. This means that there is no solution to this system of equations. Because if there were a solution then it would be a point that is on the first line and also on the second line. So it would be a point where the two lines would cross.  When there are no solutions to a system, we can simply say that. Or we can write that the solution set is the empty set, which we can write as or .   When a system of two linear equations has no solution, we call the system inconsistent . The idea is that while it may possible for and to Inconsistent system have the relationship given by the first equation, and while it may possible for and Inconsistent equations  to have the relationship given by the second equation, it's not possible for Equation(s) inconsistent both of these relationships to happen at the same time: they are inconsistent.   The Symbol is not Zero  The symbol is a special symbol that represents an empty set, a set with no Empty set numbers in it. You could also write the empty set as braces with nothing in between them, Set empty like . But is a fancy alternative. This symbol is not the same thing as the number zero. The symbol represents a set with nothing in it. The symbol represents the number zero. If you have an empty carton of eggs, the carton itself would be , while is the count of how many eggs are in that carton.    Coinciding Lines  Consider the graphs of two lines with equations and . In other words, the system:   To solve this system of equations, we want to graph each line. The first equation is in slope-intercept form and we graph it by starting at the -intercept and using the slope to make slope triangles.  The second equation is in standard form. We find its -intercept is and its -intercept is , and use this to plot the line. The two lines are plotted together in .   Now we can see these two lines are actually the same line. They coincide. Can we really solve this system? Finding a solution means finding a point that is a solution to each of the two lines in the system. But apparently any point on this one line we see is actually a solution to both of the original line equations. So we have an infinite number of solutions. All points that fall on that one line are in the solution set.   Graphs of and   a coordinate plot of two lines that are coinciding; they each have a y-intercept of (0,-4) and a slope of 2      It may be enough for us to report that there are infinitely many solutions, not just one. But we could also be more specific and use set-builder notation. We want to write that any ordered pair that satisfies one (or the other) of the two original line equations is actually a solution to the system. We can write that the solution set is .   When a system of two linear equations has infinitely many solutions, we call the system dependent . The two equation may not have looked identical, but it turned out that Dependent system they represented the same line. So in a sense, the two equations depend on one another Dependent equations (since actually they are equivalent equations). Equation(s) dependent    In , what would have happened if we had decided to convert the second line equation into slope-intercept form? This is the literally the same as the first equation from that system. This is a different way to show that these two equations represent coinciding lines.    Notice that for a system of equations with infinite solutions like , we didn't say that everything is a solution. It's only the points that are on that coinciding line that are solutions. It would be incorrect to say that the solution set is all real numbers or as all ordered pairs .      Solve the following system of equations by graphing.              If we graph these lines, we find they are the same line.    a coordinate plot of two lines that are coinciding; they each have a y-intercept of (0,-5) and an x-intercept of (8,0)   So there are infinitely many solutions: all points on that common line.           Solve the following system of equations by graphing.              If we graph these lines, we find they are parallel and never cross.    a coordinate plot of two lines that are coinciding; they each have a y-intercept of (0,-5) and an x-intercept of (8,0)   So there are no solutions to this system.        We can summarize the possibilities for a solution set to a system of two linear equations in two variables.   Three Types of Systems of Two Linear Equations in Two Variables  Systems of two linear equations number of solutions    Crossing Lines  If two linear equations make lines with different slopes, the system has one solution. That one solution is the place where the lines cross.    Parallel Lines  If two linear equations make lines with the same slope but different -intercepts, the system has no solution.    Coinciding Lines  If two linear equations make lines with the same slope and the same -intercept (in other words, they make the same line), the system has infinitely many solutions. This solution set consists of all ordered pairs on that line.         What is the purpose of the one big left brace in a system of two equations?       When you find a solution to a system of two linear equations in two variables, why should you check the solution?       When you are checking a solution to a system of two linear equations in two variables, would it be good enough to only substitute the numbers into one of the original two equations? Why or why not?       Suppose you have a system of two linear equations, and you know the system has exactly one solution. What can you say about the slopes of the two lines?        Review    Select the equations\/inequalities that are linear with one variable.                          None of the above                                       None of the above           is not linear because it multiplies two variables together.  and are not linear because variables are raised to the second power.  is not linear because a variable is within absolute value bars.  That leaves and which are both linear.            Skills Practice   Check a Possible Solution to a System   Check if the given point is a solution to the given system of two linear equations.

Identify Solution from Graph   The graph of two lines represents a system of two linear equations. Use the graph to identify the solution to the system.        a coordinate plot of two lines that cross at (-2, 5)                   a coordinate plot of two lines that cross at (-1, 2)                   a coordinate plot of two lines that cross at (1, -3)                   a coordinate plot of two lines that cross at (2, 5)                   a coordinate plot of two parallel lines                   a coordinate plot of two parallel lines                See How Many Solutions   Simply by looking closely at the linear equations, determine how many solutions the system will have.

His budget for beverages is and he will try to spend all of it. He assumes that people will attend, and there should be two beverages available per person. Phoenix has decided to order cans of a fancy beverage that cost each, and cans of a cheaper beverage that cost each. How many of each should he order?    Write two equations that form a system for this scenario.             Since there are people and there should be two drinks per person, one equation is  Since the first type costs each, the second type costs each, and the total should be another equation is     Plot the lines for the system of two equations.        Plotting the two slope-intercept equations:    a Cartesian grid with two intersecting lines; one line passes through (0,54\/2) and (54\/3,0); the other line passes through (0,2*12) and (2*12,0); the lines cross at (6,18)      Based on the graph, how many of the more expensive beverage should Phoenix buy?  How many of the less expensive beverage should Phoenix buy?             The lines cross at So Phoenix should buy 6 of the more expensive drink, and 18 of the less expensive drink.            At the local hardware store, Jayda bought a hammer and four boxes of nails. The total cost was The hammer costs more than a box of nails. How much does a hammer cost and how much does one box of nails cost?    Write two equations that form a system for this scenario.             Since the total cost of the hammer and four boxes of nails is one equation is  Since the hammer costs more than a box of nails, another equation is     Plot the lines for the system of two equations.        Plotting the two slope-intercept equations:    a Cartesian grid with two intersecting lines; one line passes through (0,56\/4) and (56,0); the other line passes through (0,-36) and (36,0); the lines cross at (40,4)      Based on the graph, how much does the hammer cost?  How much does a box of nails cost?             The lines cross at So a hammer costs and a box of nails costs $4.            Shayla enters a grassy field from some dense trees. Her dog is standing out in the field, away. As soon as they see each other, they start running toward each other. Shayla runs with speed and her dog runs with speed How long will it be until they meet?    Write two equations that form a system for this scenario.             Shayla starts out at position running with speed So one equation is  The dog starts running with speed but getting closer to Shayla. So we ll use a negative rate of change. And the dog starts out away. So the other equation is     Plot the lines for the system of two equations.        Plotting the two slope-intercept equations:    a Cartesian grid with two intersecting lines; one line passes through (0,55) with slope 3; the other line passes through (0,0) with slope -8; the lines cross at (5,15)      Based on the graph, how long will it be until they meet?

Write two equations that form a system for this scenario.             The bicycle starts out away and is traveling at So one equation is  The dog starts running at time with speed So the other equation is     Plot the lines for the system of two equations.

How far will that be from the place where the dog started running?             The lines cross at So after seconds, the cyclist and the dog are each 300 feet away from where the dog started running.           "

If she started out at position meters, then her position in meters after seconds is given by David is running more slowly, at only . But he had a head start, starting out at a position meters ahead of Fabiana. So David's position in meters after seconds is given by One of these equations represents Fabiana, and the other represents David. But imagine if you could find a point that worked as a solution to Fabiana's equation and also as a solution to David's equation. That would mean there is a moment in time ( seconds after the clock started) when Fabiana's position equals David's position. (Both runners would be meters from the starting point.) In other words, this would be the moment when Fabiana catches up to David.  So we consider the two equations together: We have a system of two equations in two variables. And if we can find a common solution to both equations, we have figured out something meaningful.  "

  "body": " Substitution   In , we used graphing to solve a system of two linear equations. While graphing is insightful, it can be time-consuming. And what happens if the actual solution to the system does not have whole number coordinates will you be able to see exactly what are the coordinates of the crossing? And what if your hand-drawn graph has some small imperfection that makes it look like the lines are crossing at the wrong place?  There are two main alternatives to graphing that can find the solution to a system of two linear equations. They use pencil-and-paper algebra instead of a picture. This section covers one of those alternative methods, and the next section covers the other.   Alternative Video Lesson      Substitution   The Interview  Systems of linear equations solved by substitution  Substitution method  Systems of linear equations applications  Substitution method problem solving with  Once upon a time, the New York Times published an article about the movie, The Interview . It included the following quote:    The Interview generated roughly million in online sales and rentals during its first four days of availability, Sony Pictures said on Sunday.  Sony did not say how much of that total represented digital rentals versus sales. The studio said there were about two million transactions overall.   Note the article is suggesting that we do not know how many rentals there were and how many sales there were. A few days later, Joey Devilla cleverly pointed out in his blog that there is enough information here to use algebra to figure out the number of sales and the number of rentals. We can write a system of equations and solve it to find the two quantities. (Since the numbers given in the article are only approximations, the solutions we find will also only be approximations.)  First, we will define variables. There are two unknown quantities: how many sales there were and how many rentals there were. Let be the number of rental transactions and let be the number of sales transactions.  If you are unsure how to write an equation from the background information, use the units to help you. The units of each term in an equation must match because we can only add like quantities. Both and are measured in transactions . The article says that the total number of transactions is two million. So our first equation will add the total number of rental and sales transactions and set that equal to two million. Our equation is: Without the units:   The price of each rental was . That means the problem has given us a rate of to work with. The rate unit suggests this should be multiplied by something measured in transactions. It makes sense to multiply by , and that would give us the total number of dollars generated from rentals. This is . Similarly, the price of each sale was , so the revenue from sales was . The total revenue was million, which we can represent with this equation: Without the units:   Here is our system of equations, with the commas removed: To solve the system, we will use a method called substitution . The idea is to use one equation to isolate . Then substitute this for the that's in the other equation. This leaves you with one equation where the only variable is . And we can handle that directly.  The first equation from the system is an easy one to isolate : This tells us that the expression is equal to , so we can substitute that in place of in the second equation: Now we have an equation with only one variable, .   At this point, we know that . This tells us that out of the million transactions, roughly were from online sales. Recall that we isolated previously and found . In summary, there were roughly sales and roughly rentals.    In , we rounded the solution values because only whole numbers make sense in the context of the problem. It was especially acceptable to round because the original numbers we worked with were already rounded. In fact, it would be OK to round even more to something like and as long as we communicate clearly that we rounded.  In other exercises where there is no context, it is not OK to round. Solutions should be communicated with their exact values.     Solve the system of equations using substitution:     To use substitution, we need to isolate one of the variables in one of our equations. Looking over both equations, it will be easiest to isolate in the first equation:   Next, we substitute in for in the second equation, giving us a linear equation in only one variable . And this is an equation that we may solve using skills from .   Now that we have the value for , we need to find the value for . We already isolated , and it's easiest to just use that equation.   At this point we think the solution is the point or in other words: , . It's only human to make mistakes though, so we should check that the solution actually works. To check it, try using , in both of the original equations.   We conclude then that this system of equations is true when and . The solution is the point and we write the solution set as .

And sometimes it makes more sense to isolate the second variable instead of the first.    Solve this system of equations using substitution:     We need to isolate one of the variables in one of the equations. Looking over both equations, it will be easiest to isolate in the second equation because that is where the coefficient is smallest. We are going to have to divide by some coefficient; it might as well be the smallest one to keep the fraction arithmetic as simple as we can. Note that there are fractions once we've isolated . We should take care with the steps that follow to make sure that the fraction arithmetic is correct.  Substitute in for in the first equation, and that leads to having a single linear equation with only one variable. We can solve this as we did in . Note the step in the middle where we clear denominators.   Now that we have the value for , we need to find the value for . We already isolated , and it's easiest to just use that equation.   To check the solution we think we've found, try using , in both of the original equations.   We conclude then that this system of equations is true when and . The solution is the point and we write the solution set as .    A system may start out with fractions among the coefficients. Just as we learned in , the algebra can go more smoothly if we clear the denominators before doing more work.    Solve the system of equations using the substitution method.     When a system of equations has fraction coefficients, it may be helpful to clear the denominators . With each equation, multiply each side by the least common multiple of that equation's denominators.   In the first equation, the least common multiple of the denominators is , so:   In the second equation, the least common multiple of the denominators is , so:    Now we have a system that is equivalent to the original system of equations, but there are no fraction coefficients: The second equation has already isolated , so we will substitute in for in the first equation. And we have solved for . To find , we know , so we have: The solution is . (This should be checked in the original two equations though.)    Real world applications can lead to a system where both equations are either in point-slope form or slope-intercept form. This is helpful, since it means one variable has already been isolated.    Solve the system of equations using the substitution method.     In the first equation, is already isolated. So we can substitute in for in the second equation: .  Some people prefer to think of this as setting the two right sides equal to each other. That works too: if is equal to , and is also equal to , then these expressions are equal to each other. Either way: And then: And the solution is .    For summary reference, here is the general procedure.   Solving Systems of Equations by Substitution  Systems of linear equations solved by substitution  Substitution method  To solve a system of two linear equations in two variables by substitution,   If helpful, clear denominators from each equation using the least common multiple of each equation's denominators.    Isolate one variable in one of the equations.    Substitute that expression into the other equation. There should now only be one variable in that equation.    Solve that equation for the one remaining variable.    Substitute that value into the earlier result where the first variable was isolated, and solve for that variable.    Verify your solution using the original two equations.        Applications  Systems of linear equations applications  Mathematical models involving a system of linear equations  Problem solving with substitution method  Substitution method problem solving with   Two Different Interest Rates   Notah made some large purchases with his two credit cards one month and took on a total of in debt from the two cards. He didn't make any payments the first month, so the two credit card debts each started accruing interest. That month, his Visa card charged interest and his Mastercard charged interest. Because of this, Notah's total debt grew by . How much money did Notah charge to each card?    We start by clearly defining two variables for the two unknowns. Let be the amount charged to the Visa card (in dollars) and let be the amount charged to the Mastercard (in dollars).  To set up the equations, notice that we are given two different total dollar amounts. One is the total debt Notah initially took on, . So we have: Or without units: The other total we were given is the total amount of interest, . The Visa had dollars charged to it and accrues interest. So is the dollar amount of interest that comes from using the Visa card. Similarly, is the dollar amount of interest from using the Mastercard. Together: Or without units: As a system, we write:   To solve this system by substitution, notice that it will be easier to isolate one of the variables in the first equation. We'll isolate : Now we substitute in for in the second equation: And then we can determine the value of by using the earlier equation where we isolated :   In summary, Notah charged to the Visa and to the Mastercard. We should check that these numbers work as solutions to our original system and that they make sense in context. (For instance, if one of these numbers were negative, or was something small like , they wouldn't make sense as credit card debt.)    The next two examples are called mixture problems , because they involve mixing two quantities together to form a combination and we want to find out how much of each quantity to mix.   Mixing Solutions with Two Different Concentrations  Mixture problems  Solution mixture problems  Substitution method problem solving with   LaVonda is a meticulous bartender and she needs to serve milliliters of Rob Roy, a cocktail that is alcohol by volume. The main ingredients are scotch that is alcohol and vermouth that is alcohol. How many milliliters of each ingredient should she mix together to make the concentration she needs?    The two unknowns are the quantities of each ingredient. Let be the amount of scotch (in ) and let be the amount of vermouth (in ).  One quantity given to us in the problem is 600 . Since this is the total volume of the mixed drink, we must have: Or without units:   To build the second equation, we have to think about the alcohol concentrations for the pure scotch, pure vermouth, and the mixed Rob Roy. It can be tricky to think about percentages like these correctly. One strategy is to focus on the amount of alcohol (in ). If we have milliliters of scotch that is alcohol, then is the actual amount of alcohol (in ) in that scotch. Similarly, is the amount of alcohol in the vermouth. And the final cocktail is 600 of liquid that is alcohol. So it has milliliters of alcohol. This is telling us: Or without units:   So our system is:   To solve this system, we'll isolate in the first equation: And then substitute in for in the second equation with : Now we determine using the equation where we had isolated :   In summary, LaVonda needs to combine 400 of scotch with 200 of vermouth to create 600 of Rob Roy.    Let's take a moment to consider estimation to ask whether the solution to is reasonable. LaVonda will mix scotch ( concentration) with vermouth ( concentration) and wants to end with a concentration. Is closer to or ? It's closer to so we should expect there to be more scotch than vermouth. This agrees with the solution we found.   Mixing a Coffee Blend    Desi owns a coffee shop and they want to mix two different types of coffee beans to make a blend that sells for per pound. They have some coffee beans from Columbia that sell for per pound and some coffee beans from Honduras that sell for per pound. How many pounds of each should they mix to make pounds of the blend?    Write two equations that form a system for this scenario.             We have pounds of Columbian coffee and pounds of Honduran coffee. Since there must be pounds total, one equation is  The total cost of the Colombian coffee in the blend will be and the total cost of the Honduran coffee in the blend will be All together, the blend has a total cost of dollars. So another equation is     Isolate one of the variables in one of the equations.        We choose to isolate in the first equation. All we need to do subtract from each side, and then     Substitute the isolated expression into the other equation.        Making the substitution:     Solve this equation in one variable and then solve for the other variable using the isolation from a previous step. Finally, report how much of each type of coffee Desi should use.               In summary, Desi needs to mix pounds of the Honduran coffee beans with pounds of the Columbian coffee beans to create this blend.           Solving Special Systems of Equations with Substitution  Remember the two special cases for a system of two linear equations? We studied them in . If the two lines have the same slope, then they might be distinct lines that never meet, and then the system has no solutions. Or they might coincide as the same line, in which case there are infinitely many solutions represented by all the points on that line. In these cases, when we try to use substitution, interesting things happen.   A System with No Solution  Systems of linear equations with no solution   Solve the system of equations using the substitution method:     Since the first equation has already isolated , we will substitute in for in the second equation, and we have:   Even though we were only intending to replace in the second equation, it turned out that all instances of disappear too. There are no variables at all in what remains. This will happen whenever the two lines from a system have the same slope. In this case, since is false no matter what values and might be, there can be no solution to the system. If we graphed the two lines from this system, we would see them as parallel and distinct . We can say that there are no solutions, or that the solution set is empty. The solution set is , or .  For verification, let's re-write the second equation in slope-intercept form: So the system is equivalent to: Now it is easier to see that the two lines have the same slope but different -intercepts. The lines are parallel and distinct confirming that there should be no solution to the system.     A System with Infinitely Many Solutions  Systems of linear equations with infinitely many solutions   Solve the system of equations using the substitution method:     Since is already isolated in the first line, we will use that and substitute in for in the second equation:   Once again, after the substitution we find ourselves with an equation where there are no variables. This time, it is an outright true equation; really does equal . What does this mean for the original system of equations though? Apparently as long as equals , then both of the original equations are true. It's obvious that makes the first equation true, but our algebra above shows that also makes the second equation true. So there are infinitely many solutions. If we want to, we can write the solution set using set-builder notation: . Ultimately the two lines from the system were actually the same line.  For verification, let's re-write the second equation in slope-intercept form: So the system is equivalent to: Now it is clear that the two equations represent the same line. So every point on that line is a solution, and there are infinitely many solutions.        Give an example of a system of two equations in and where it would be nicer to solve the system using substitution than by graphing the two lines that the equations define. Explain why substitution would be nicer than graphing for your example system.       What can be helpful if you have a system of two linear equations in two variables where there are fractions appearing in the equations?       In an application problem, thinking about the can help you understand how to set up equations.

Sony did not say how much of that total represented digital rentals versus sales. The studio said there were about two million transactions overall.

So we have: Or without units: The other total we were given is the total amount of interest, . The Visa had dollars charged to it and accrues interest. So is the dollar amount of interest that comes from using the Visa card. Similarly, is the dollar amount of interest from using the Mastercard. Together: Or without units: As a system, we write:   To solve this system by substitution, notice that it will be easier to isolate one of the variables in the first equation. We'll isolate : Now we substitute in for in the second equation: And then we can determine the value of by using the earlier equation where we isolated :   In summary, Notah charged to the Visa and to the Mastercard. We should check that these numbers work as solutions to our original system and that they make sense in context. (For instance, if one of these numbers were negative, or was something small like , they wouldn't make sense as credit card debt.)   "

The main ingredients are scotch that is alcohol and vermouth that is alcohol. How many milliliters of each ingredient should she mix together to make the concentration she needs?    The two unknowns are the quantities of each ingredient. Let be the amount of scotch (in ) and let be the amount of vermouth (in ).  One quantity given to us in the problem is 600 . Since this is the total volume of the mixed drink, we must have: Or without units:   To build the second equation, we have to think about the alcohol concentrations for the pure scotch, pure vermouth, and the mixed Rob Roy. It can be tricky to think about percentages like these correctly. One strategy is to focus on the amount of alcohol (in ). If we have milliliters of scotch that is alcohol, then is the actual amount of alcohol (in ) in that scotch. Similarly, is the amount of alcohol in the vermouth. And the final cocktail is 600 of liquid that is alcohol. So it has milliliters of alcohol. This is telling us: Or without units:   So our system is:   To solve this system, we'll isolate in the first equation: And then substitute in for in the second equation with : Now we determine using the equation where we had isolated :   In summary, LaVonda needs to combine 400 of scotch with 200 of vermouth to create 600 of Rob Roy.

Write two equations that form a system for this scenario.             We have pounds of Columbian coffee and pounds of Honduran coffee.

So another equation is     Isolate one of the variables in one of the equations.        We choose to isolate in the first equation. All we need to do subtract from each side, and then     Substitute the isolated expression into the other equation.

  "body": " Factoring Out the Common Factor   In , we learned how to multiply polynomials, such as when you start with and obtain . This chapter, starting with this section, is about the opposite process factoring. For example, starting with and obtaining . We will start with the simplest kind of factoring: for example starting with and obtaining .   Alternative Video Lesson      Motivation for Factoring  When you write , you have an algebraic expression built with two terms two parts that are added together. When you write , you have an algebraic expression built with two factors two parts that are multiplied together. Factoring is useful, because sometimes (but not always) having your expression written as parts that are multiplied together makes it easy to simplify the expression.  You've seen this with fractions. To simplify , breaking down the numerator and denominator into factors is useful: . Now you can see that the factors of cancel.    There are other reasons to appreciate the value in factoring. One reason is that there is a relationship between a factored polynomial and the horizontal intercepts of its graph. For example in the graph of , the horizontal intercepts are and . Note the -values are and , and think about what happens when you subsitutue those numbers in for in . We will explore this more fully in Section .   A graph of          Identifying the Greatest Common Factor  The most basic technique for factoring involves recognizing the greatest common factor  G.C.F.  greatest common factor between two expressions, which is the largest factor that goes in evenly to both expressions. For example, the greatest common factor between and is , since divides nicely into both and and no larger number would divide nicely into both and .  Similarly, the greatest common factor between and is . If you write as a product of its factors, you have . And if you fully factor , you have . The only factor they have in common is , so that is the greatest common factor. No larger expression goes in nicely to both expressions.   Finding the Greatest Common Factor  What is the common factor between and ? Break down each of these into its factors: And identify the common factors: With and in common, the greatest common factor is .        The greatest common factor between and is .

Perhaps you have thought of this as a way to distribute the number to each of and . In this section, we will use the distributive property in the opposite way. If you have an expression , it is equal to . In that example, we factored out , which is the common factor between and .  The following steps use the distributive property to factor out the greatest common factor between two or more terms.   Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor      Identify the greatest common factor in all terms.    Write the greatest common factor outside a pair of parentheses with the appropriate addition or subtraction signs inside.    For each term from the original expression, what would you multiply the greatest common factor by to result in that term? Write your answer in the parentheses.        To factor :   The greatest common factor between and is .                 Factor the polynomial .     We identify the greatest common factor as , because is the only common factor between , and .    We write: .    We ask the question times what gives ? The answer is . Now we have: .  We ask the question times what gives ? The answer is . Now we have: .  We ask the question times what gives ? The answer is . Now we have: .     To check that this is correct, multiplying through should give the original expression . We check this, and it does.      Factor the polynomial        In this exercise, is the greatest common factor. We find   Note that you might fail to recognize that is the greatest common factor. At first you might only find that, say, is a common factor. This is OK you can factor out the and continue from there:   Now examine the second factor here and there is still a common factor, Factoring this out too.   So there is more than one way to find the answer.          Visualizing With Rectangles  In Section , we learned one way to multiply polynomials using rectangle diagrams. Similarly, we can factor a polynomial with a rectangle diagram.   Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor Using Rectangles      Put the terms into adjacent rectangles. Think of these as labeling the areas of each rectangle.    Identify the greatest common factor, and mark the height of the overall rectangle with it.    Mark the width of each rectangle based on each rectangle's area and height.    Since the overall rectangle's area equals its width times its height, the height is one factor, and the sum of the widths is another factor.        We will factor , the same polynomial from the example in Algorithm , so that you may compare the two styles.                                        So factors as .     More Examples of Factoring out the Common Factor  Previous examples did not cover every nuance with factoring out the greatest common factor. Here are a few more factoring examples that attempt to do so.   Factor .  First, we identify the common factor. The number is the greatest common factor of the three coefficients (which were , , and ) and also is the largest expression that divides , , and . Therefore the greatest common factor is .  In this example, the leading term is a negative number. When this happens, we will make it common practice to take that negative as part of the greatest common factor. So we will proceed by factoring out . Note the signs change inside the parentheses.     Factor .  Notice that the terms are not in a standard order, with powers of decreasing as you read left to right. It is usually a best practice to rearrange the terms into the standard order first. .  The number divides all of the numerical coefficients. Separately, no power of is part of the greatest common factor because the term has no factors. So the greatest common factor is just . We proceed by factoring that out:     Factor .  There are two variables in this polynomial, but that does not change the factoring strategy. The greatest numerical factor between the three terms is . The variable divides all three terms, and divides all three terms. So we have:     Factor .  There are no common factors in those two terms (unless you want to count or , but we do not count these for the purposes of identifying a greatest common factor). In this situation we can say the polynomial is prime  prime polynomial  polynomial prime or irreducible , and leave it as it is.    Factor .  There are no common factors in those three terms, and it would be correct to state that this polynomial is prime or irreducible. However, since its leading coefficient is negative, it may be wise to factor out a negative sign. So, it could be factored as . Note that every term is negated as the leading negative sign is extracted.       Given two terms, how would you describe their greatest common factor?       If a simplified polynomial has four terms, and you factor out its greatest common factor, how many terms will remain inside a set of parentheses?

  "body": " Factoring Trinomials with Leading Coefficient One   In , we learned how to multiply binomials like and obtain the trinomial . In this section, we will learn how to undo that. So we'll be starting with a trinomial like and obtaining its factored form . The trinomials that we'll factor in this section all have leading coefficient .   Alternative Video Lesson      Factoring Trinomials by Listing Factor Pairs  factoring with factor pairs  Consider the example . There are at least three things that are important to notice:   The leading coefficient of is .    The two factors on the right use the numbers and , and when you multiply these you get the .    The two factors on the right use the numbers and , and when you add these you get the .   So the idea is that if you need to factor and you somehow discover that and are special numbers (because and ), then you can conclude that is the factored form of the given polynomial.   Factor . Since the leading coefficient is , we are looking to write this polynomial as where the question marks are two possibly different, possibly negative, numbers. We need these two numbers to multiply to and add to . How can you track these two numbers down? Since the numbers need to multiply to , one method is to list all factor pairs of in a table just to see what your options are. We'll write every pair of factors that multiply to .                                We wanted to find all factor pairs. To avoid missing any, we started using as a factor, and then slowly increased that first factor. The table skips over using as a factor, because is not a factor of . Similarly the table skips using and as a factor. And there would be no need to continue with and beyond, because we already found large factors like as the partners of small factors like .  There is an entire second column where the signs are reversed, since these are also ways to multiply two numbers to get . In the end, there are eight factor pairs.  We need a pair of numbers that also adds to . So we check what each of our factor pairs add up to:       Factor Pair  Sum of the Pair                 (what we wanted)        Factor Pair  Sum of the Pair     (no need to go this far)     (no need to go this far)     (no need to go this far)     (no need to go this far)     The winning pair of numbers is and . Again, what matters is that , and . So we can conclude that .     To ensure that we made no mistakes, here are some possible checks.   Multiply it Out  Multiplying out our answer should give us .       We could also use a rectangular area diagram to verify the factorization is correct:                       Evaluating  If the answer really is , then notice how evaluating at would result in . So the original expression should also result in if we evaluate at . And similarly, if we evaluate it at , should be . . This also gives us evidence that the factoring was correct.     Factor . The negative coefficient is a small complication from Example , but the process is actually still the same.    We need a pair of numbers that multiply to and add to . Note that we do care to keep track that they sum to a negative total.       Factor Pair  Sum of the Pair             (close; wrong sign)            Factor Pair  Sum of the Pair             (what we wanted)     (no need to go this far)     So . To confirm that this is correct, we should check. Either by multiplying out the factored form:                        Or by evaluating the original expression at and : . Our factorization passes the tests.      Factor . The negative coefficient is again a small complication from Example , but the process is actually still the same.    We need a pair of numbers that multiply to and add to . Note that we do care to keep track that they multiply to a negative product.       Factor Pair  Sum of the Pair     (close; wrong sign)            Factor Pair  Sum of the Pair     (what we wanted)     (no need to go this far)     So . To confirm that this is correct, we should check. Either by multiplying out the factored form:                        Or by evaluating the original expression at and : . Our factorization passes the tests.       Factor        We need a pair of numbers that multiply to and add to Note that we do care to keep track that they multiply to a negative product and sum to a negative total.       Factor Pair  Sum of the Pair             (what we wanted)    (no need to continue)  ...    So          Trinomials with Higher Powers  factoring trinomials with higher powers  So far we have only factored examples of quadratic  quadratic trinomials: trinomials whose highest power of the variable is . However, this technique can also be used to factor trinomials where there is a larger highest power of the variable. It only requires that the highest power is even, that the next highest power is half of the highest power, and that the third term is a constant term.  In the four examples below, check:   if the highest power is even    if the next highest power is half of the highest power    if the last term is constant       Factor pairs will help with                 Factor pairs won't help with                  Factor . This polynomial is one of the examples above where using factor pairs will help. We find that , and , so the numbers and can be used: Actually, once we settled on using and , we could have concluded that factors as , if we know which power of to use. We'll always use half the highest power in these factorizations.  In any case, to confirm that this is correct, we should check by multiplying out the factored form:                        Our factorization passes the tests.      Factor        We need a pair of numbers that multiply to and add to Note that we do care to keep track that they multiply to a negative product and sum to a negative total.       Factor Pair  Sum of the Pair         (what we wanted)    (no need to continue)  ...    So          Factoring in Stages  factoring in stages  Sometimes factoring a polynomial will take two or more stages. Always begin factoring a polynomial by factoring out its greatest common factor, and then apply a second stage where you use a technique from this section. The process of factoring a polynomial is not complete until each of the factors cannot be factored further.    Factor .    We will first factor out the common factor, : Now we are left with a factored expression that might factor more. Looking inside the parentheses, we ask ourselves, what two numbers multiply to be and add to be ? Since and do the job the full factorization is:       Factor .    The three terms don't exactly have a common factor, but as discussed in Section , when the leading term has a negative sign, it is often helpful to factor out that negative sign: . Looking inside the parentheses, we ask ourselves, what two numbers multiply to be and add to be ? Since and work here and the full factorization is shown:       Factor .    First, always look for the greatest common factor: in this trinomial it is . After factoring this out, we have . Looking inside the parentheses, we ask ourselves, what two numbers multiply to be and add to be ? Since and fit the bill, the full factorization can be shown below:       More Trinomials with Two Variables  You might encounter a trinomial with two variables that can be factored using the methods we've discussed in this section. It can be tricky though: has two variables and it can factor using the methods from this section, but also has two variables and it cannot be factored. So in examples of this nature, it is even more important to check that factorizations you find actually work.   Factor . This is a trinomial, and the coefficient of is , so maybe we can factor it. We want to write where the question marks will be something that makes it all multiply out to .  Since the last term in the polynomial has a factor of , it is natural to wonder if there is a factor of in each of the two question marks. If there were, these two factors of would multiply to . So it is natural to wonder if we are looking for where now the question marks are just numbers.  At this point we can think like we have throughout this section. Are there some numbers that multiply to and add to ? Yes, specifically and . So we suspect that might be the factorization.  To confirm that this is correct, we should check by multiplying out the factored form:                        Our factorization passes the tests.       To factor , you look for two numbers that do what?      How many factor pairs are there for the number ?       Review and Warmup     Multiply the polynomials.

And when they have these patterns, there are formulas you can use to factor them, much more quickly than using the techniques from .   Alternative Video Lesson      Difference of Squares  factoring difference of squares  If is some positive integer, then when you multiply : . The and the cancel each other out. So this is telling us that . And so if we ever encounter a polynomial of the form (a difference of squares ) then we have a quick formula for factoring it. Just identify what is, and use that in .  To use this formula, it's important to recognize which numbers are perfect squares, as in Figure .    Factor .    The being subtracted here is a perfect square. It is the same as . So we can take and write:       Try to factor one yourself:     Factor        The being subtracted here is a perfect square. It is the same as So we can take and write:         We can do a little better. There is nothing special about starting with in these examples. In full generality:   The Difference of Squares Formula   If and are any algebraic expressions, then: .      Factor .    The at the beginning of this expression is a perfect square; it's the same as . The being subtracted here is also perfect square. We can take and , and use :       Factor .    Is the at the beginning of this expression a perfect square? By the properties of exponents, it is the same as , so yes, it is a perfect square and we may take . The being subtracted here is also perfect square. We can take . tells us:       Try to factor one yourself:     Factor        The at the beginning here is a perfect square. It is the same as So we can take The being subtracted is also a perfect square, so we can take           Factor .    Is the at the beginning of this expression is a perfect square? It may appear to be a sixth power, but it is also a perfect square because we can write . So we may take . The being subtracted here is also perfect square. We can take . tells us:      It's a common mistake to write something like . This is not what allows you to do, and this is in fact incorrect. The issue is that is a sum of squares, not a difference . And it happens that is actually prime. In fact, any sum of squares without a common factor will always be prime.     Perfect Square Trinomials  factoring perfect square trinomials  If we expand : . The and the equal each other and double up when added together. So this is telling us that . And so if we ever encounter a polynomial of the form (a perfect square trinomial ) then we have a quick formula for factoring it.  The tricky part is recognizing when a trinomial you have encountered is in this special form. Ask yourself:   Are the first and last terms perfect square? If so, jot down what and would be.    When you multiply with what you wrote down for and , i.e. , do you have the middle term? If you have this middle term exactly, then your polynomial factors as . If the middle term is the negative of , then the sign on your can be reversed, and your polynomial factors as .      The Perfect Square Trinomial Formula   If and are any algebraic expressions, then:       Factor .    The first term, , is clearly a perfect square. So we could take . The last term, , is also a perfect square since it is equal to . So we could take . Now we multiply , and the result is . This is the middle term, which is what we hope to see.  So we can use :       Factor .    The first term, , is a perfect square because it equals . So we could take . The last term, , is also a perfect square since it is equal to . So we could take . Now we multiply , and the result is . This is the negative of the middle term, which we can work with. The factored form will be instead of .  So we can use :       Try to factor one yourself:     Factor        The first term, is a perfect square because it equals So we could take The last term, is also a perfect square since it is equal to So we could take Now we multiply and the result is This is the middle term, which is what we hope to see.  So we can use The Perfect Square Trinomial Formula:          It is not enough to just see that the first and last terms are perfect squares. For example, has its first term equal to and its last term equal to . But when you examine the result is , not equal to the middle term. So doesn't apply here. In fact, this polynomial doesn't factor at all.    To factor these perfect square trinomials, we could use methods from . As an exercise for yourself, try to factor each of the three previous examples using those methods. The advantage to using is that it is much faster. With some practice, all of the work for using it can be done mentally.      Factoring in Stages  Sometimes factoring a polynomial will take two or more stages. You might use one of the special patters to factor something into two factors, and then those factors might factor even more. When the task is to factor a polynomial, the intention is that you fully factor it, breaking down the pieces into even smaller pieces when that is possible.   Factor out any greatest common factor   Factor .    The two terms of this polynomial have greatest common factor , so the first step in factoring should be to factor this out: . Now we have two factors. There is nothing for us to do with , but we should ask if can factor further. And in fact, that is a difference of squares. So we can apply . The full process would be:      Recognize a second special pattern   Factor .    Since is the same as , we have a difference of squares here. We can apply : It doesn't end here. Of the two factors we found, cannot be factored further. But the other one, is also a difference of squares. So we should apply again:          Factor .    The first step of factoring any polynomial is to factor out the common factor if possible. For this trinomial, the common factor is , so we write .  The square numbers and in hint that maybe we could use . Taking and , we multiply . The result is , which is the negative of our middle term. So the whole process is:         Describe two special patterns where it is possible to memorize a quick factoring shortcut as discussed in this section.

  "body": " Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring   Introduction  We have learned how to factor trinomials like into . This skill can be used to solve an equation like , which is a quadratic equation.   Quadratic Equation  quadratic equation in standard form  standard form of a quadratic equation  quadratic equation  equation quadratic   A quadratic equation is is an equation in the form with . We also consider equations such as and to be quadratic equations, because we can expand any multiplication, add or subtract terms from both sides, and combine like terms to get the form . The form is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.     Alternative Video Lesson    Before we begin exploring the method of solving quadratic equations by factoring, we'll identify what types of equations are quadratic and which are not.     Identify which of the items are quadratic equations.   The equation   is   is not  a quadratic equation.    The equation   is   is not  a quadratic equation.    The equation   is   is not  a quadratic equation.    The equation   is   is not  a quadratic equation.    The equation   is   is not  a quadratic equation.    The expression   is   is not  a quadratic equation.    The equation   is   is not  a quadratic equation.                                          The equation  is a quadratic equation. To write it in standard form, simply subtract from both sides.    The equation  is not quadratic. It is a linear equation.    The equation  is not a quadratic equation because of the term.    The equation  is a quadratic equation. If we expand the left-hand side of the equation, we would get something in standard form.    The equation  is not a quadratic equation. If we expanded the left-hand side of the equation, we would have an expression with an term, which automatically makes it not quadratic.    The expression  is not a quadratic equation; it s not an equation at all. Instead, this is a quadratic expression .    The equation  is a quadratic equation. Multiplying out the left-hand side, and subtracting form both sides, we would have a quadratic equation in standard form.          Now we'll look at an application that demonstrates the need and method for solving a quadratic equation by factoring.   Nita is in a physics class that launches a tennis ball from a rooftop feet above the ground. They fire it directly upward at a speed of feet per second and measure the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground below. We can model the height of the tennis ball, , in feet, with the quadratic equation , where represents the time in seconds after the launch. Using the model we can predict when the ball will hit the ground.   A Diagram of the Ball Thrown from the Roof   A drawing of a tall building and a tennis ball being launched upward; the path of the ball is an arc that goes upward and then downward to the ground      The ground has a height of , or . We will substitute for in the equation and we have We need to solve this quadratic equation for to find when the ball will hit the ground.  The key strategy for solving a linear equation is to separate the variable terms from the constant terms on either side of the equal sign. It turns out that this same method will not work for quadratic equations. Fortunately, we already have spent a good amount of time discussing a method that will work: factoring. If we can factor the polynomial on the left-hand side, we will be on the home stretch to solving the whole equation.  We will look for a common factor first, and see that we can factor out . Then we can finish factoring the trinomial:   In order to finish solving the equation, we need to understand the following property. This property explains why it was incredibly important to move the in our example over to the other side of the equation before trying to factor.   Zero Product Property  zero product property  properties zero product property   If the product of two or more numbers is equal to zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero.    One way to understand this property is to think about the equation . Maybe , because that would certainly cause the equation to be true. But suppose that . Then it is safe to divide both sides by , and the resulting equation says that . So no matter what, either or .  To understand this property more, let's look at a few products: When none of the factors are , the result is never . The only way to get a product of is when one of the factors is . This property is unique to the number and can be used no matter how many numbers are multiplied together.  Now we can see the value of factoring. We have three factors in our equation . The first factor is the number . The second and third factors, and , are expressions that represent numbers. Since the product of the three factors is equal to , one of the factors must be zero.  Since is not , either or must be . This gives us two equations to solve: We have found two solutions, and . A quadratic expression will have at most two linear factors, not including any constants, so it can have up to two solutions.  Let's check each of our two solutions and :   We have verified our solutions. While there are two solutions to the equation, the solution is not relevant to this physics model because it is a negative time which would tell us something about the ball's height before it was launched. The solution does make sense. According to the model, the tennis ball will hit the ground seconds after it is launched.    Further Examples  solving quadratic equations factoring  We'll now look at further examples of solving quadratic equations by factoring. The general process is outlined here:   Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring  solving quadratic equations by factoring     Simplify  Simplify the equation using distribution and by combining like terms.    Isolate  Move all terms onto one side of the equation so that the other side has .    Factor  Factor the quadratic expression.    Apply the Zero Product Property  Apply the .    Solve  Solve the equation(s) that result after the zero product property was applied.        Solve by factoring.      The solutions are and , so the solution set is written as .      Solve by using graphing technology.    We have already solved the equation by factoring in Example , and now we can analyze the significance of the solutions graphically. What will and mean on the graph?   To solve this equation graphically, we first make a graph of and of . Both of these graphs are shown in in an appropriate window.   A graph of and .        From the graph provided we can see that the solutions (the -values where the graphs intersect) are and .    If the two factors of a polynomial happen to be the same, the equation will only have one solution. Let's look at an example of that.   A Quadratic Equation with Only One Solution   Solve by factoring.     The solution is , so the solution set is written as .  While we are examining this problem, let's compare the algebraic solution to a graphical solution.   To solve this equation graphically, we first make a graph of and of . Both of these graphs are shown in in an appropriate window.   A graph of and .        From the graph provided, we can see that the reason that the equation has only one solution is that the parabola touches the line only once. So again, the solution is .     Factor Out a Common Factor   Solve by factoring.    Note that the terms are all divisible by , so we can factor that out to start.  The solution set is .     Factoring Using the AC Method   Solve by factoring.    Recall that we multiply and find a factor pair that multiplies to and adds to . The factors are and . We use the two factors to replace the middle term with and .  The solution set is .    So far the equations have been written in standard form, which is If an equation is not given in standard form then we must rearrange it in order to use the .   Writing in Standard Form   Solve by factoring.    There is nothing like the for the number . We must have a on one side of the equation to solve quadratic equations using factoring.  The solution set is .     Writing in Standard Form   Solve by factoring.    Again, there is nothing like the for a number like . We must expand the left side and subtract from both sides.  The solution set is .     A Quadratic Equation with No Constant Term   Solve by factoring.    It may be tempting to divide both sides of the equation by . But is a variable, and for all we know, maybe . So it is not safe to divide by . As a general rule, never divide an equation by a variable in the solving process. Instead, we will put the equation in standard form. We can factor out .  The solution set is . In general, if a quadratic equation does not have a constant term, then will be one of the solutions.  While we are examining this problem, let's compare the algebraic solution to a graphical solution.   To solve this equation graphically, we first make a graph of and of . Both of these graphs are shown in in an appropriate window.   A graph of and .        From the graph provided, we can see that the equation has two solutions because the graph of crosses the graph of twice. Those solutions, the -values where the graphs cross, appear to be and .     Factoring a Special Polynomial   Solve by factoring.    We can put the equation in standard form and use factoring. In this case, we find a difference of squares.  The solution set is .     Solving an Equation with a Higher Degree   Solve by factoring.    Although this equation is not quadratic, it does factor so we can solve it by factoring.  The solution set is .      Applications   Kicking it on Mars    Some time in the recent past, Filip traveled to Mars for a vacation with his kids, Henrik and Karina, who wanted to kick a soccer ball around in the comparatively reduced gravity. Karina stood at point and kicked the ball over her dad standing at point to Henrik standing at point . The height of the ball off the ground, in feet, can be modeled by the equation , where is how far to the right the ball is from Filip. Note that distances to the left of Filip will be negative.   Find out how high the ball was above the ground when it passed over Filip's head.    Find the distance from Karina to Henrik.      A Soccer Kick on Mars   a coordinate plane with a dot for Karina, Filip and Henrik; There is an arc from Karina to Henrik that goes over Filip           The ball was neither left nor right of Filip when it went over him, so . Plugging that value into our equation for , It seems that the soccer ball was feet above the ground when it flew over Filip.    The distance from Karina to Henrik is the same as the distance from point to point . These are the horizontal intercepts of the graph of the given formula: . To find the horizontal intercepts, set and solve for . Note that we can divide by on both sides of the equation to simplify. So, either: Since the -values are how far right or left the points are from Filip, Karina is standing feet left of Filip and Henrik is standing feet right of Filip. Thus, the two kids are feet apart.      It is worth noting that if this same kick, with same initial force at the same angle, took place on Earth, the ball would have traveled less than feet from Karina before landing!   A Soccer Kick on Mars and the Same Kick on Earth   The previous coordinate plane with a scale added so that Filip is standing at the origin; the scale on the x-axis is 20 feet and the scale on the y-axis is 10 feet; there is an arc for the soccer ball on Earth that would travel 30 feet; the arc for the ball kicked on the moon would travel 110 feet         An Area Application   Rajesh has a hot tub and he wants to build a deck around it. The hot tub is  7  by  5  and it is covered by a roof that is  99  . How wide can he make the deck so that it will be covered by the roof?    We will define to represent the width of the deck (in feet). Here is a diagram to help us understand the scenario.   Diagram for the Deck   A diagram with a 7x5 rectangle for the hot tub; there is a larger rectangle around the hot tub for the deck, which extends x feet on each side of the hot tub     The overall length is feet, because Rajesh is adding feet on each side. Similarly, the overall width is feet.  The formula for the area of a rectangle is . Since the total area of the roof is  99  , we can write and solve the equation:    Since a length cannot be negative, we take as the only applicable solution. Rajesh should make the deck  2  wide on each side to fit under the roof.        If you use factoring to solve a polynomial equation, what number should be the only thing on one side of the equation?      When you are trying to solve a quadratic equation where the leading coefficient is not m and you want to use factoring, and you have moved all terms to one side so that the other side is , what should you look for before trying anything else?

The height of the ball off the ground, in feet, can be modeled by the equation , where is how far to the right the ball is from Filip. Note that distances to the left of Filip will be negative.   Find out how high the ball was above the ground when it passed over Filip's head.    Find the distance from Karina to Henrik.      A Soccer Kick on Mars   a coordinate plane with a dot for Karina, Filip and Henrik; There is an arc from Karina to Henrik that goes over Filip           The ball was neither left nor right of Filip when it went over him, so . Plugging that value into our equation for , It seems that the soccer ball was feet above the ground when it flew over Filip.    The distance from Karina to Henrik is the same as the distance from point to point . These are the horizontal intercepts of the graph of the given formula: . To find the horizontal intercepts, set and solve for . Note that we can divide by on both sides of the equation to simplify. So, either: Since the -values are how far right or left the points are from Filip, Karina is standing feet left of Filip and Henrik is standing feet right of Filip. Thus, the two kids are feet apart.      It is worth noting that if this same kick, with same initial force at the same angle, took place on Earth, the ball would have traveled less than feet from Karina before landing!   A Soccer Kick on Mars and the Same Kick on Earth   The previous coordinate plane with a scale added so that Filip is standing at the origin; the scale on the x-axis is 20 feet and the scale on the y-axis is 10 feet; there is an arc for the soccer ball on Earth that would travel 30 feet; the arc for the ball kicked on the moon would travel 110 feet       "

  "body": " Solving Quadratic Equations by Using a Square Root   In this section, we learn how to solve certain types of quadratic equations by using a square root. We will also learn about the Pythagorean Theorem, which is used to find a right triangle's side length when the other two lengths are known.   Alternative Video Lesson      Solving Quadratic Equations Using the Square Root Property  solving quadratic equations using the square root property  When we learned how to solve linear equations, we used inverse operations to isolate the variable. For example, we use subtraction to remove an unwanted term that is added to one side of a linear equation. When a variable appears in an equation and it is squared , we might be able to do something similar and use a square root to help find the solution(s). Taking the square root is the inverse of squaring if you happen to know the original number was positive. Even if you don't know that, we can still come to a conclusion about solutions to certain types of equation where the variable is squared.  For example, if , we can think of undoing the square with a square root, and we know . However, there are actually two numbers that we can square to get : as well as . Both are solutions, and both are in the solution set. This demonstrates something called the Square Root Property.   Square Root Property  square root property  properties square root property   If is positive and , then .  It is common to write for short, but it is important to remember that this means could possibly be one of two things: or . It does not mean that is two things at the same time. The positive solution, , is called the principal square root of .      Solve for in .        To check these solutions, we substitute and in for in the original equation: Both potential solutions work, and we conclude that the solution set is .     Every solution to a quadratic equation can be checked, as was done in . In the examples that follow, we won't check solutions. But you should check solutions when solving exercises for your homework or exams.      Solve for in        Before we can use the square root property we need to isolate the squared quantity.   Now we can use the square root property    The solution set is        We can also use the square root property to solve an equation that has a squared expression (as opposed to an equation that only has a squared variable).    Solve for in .    It's important here to suppress any urge you may have to expand the squared binomial. Perhaps you recently learned how to do that and practiced that skill. Good! But it would not be helpful to do that here. We will begin by isolating the squared expression.   Now that we have the squared expression isolated, we can use the square root property.  The solution set is .    This method of solving quadratic equations is not limited to equations that have rational solutions, or solutions where the radicands are perfect squares. Here are a few examples where the solutions are irrational numbers.     Solve for in        It s important to suppress any urge to expand the squared binomial.    The solution set is        If we solve an equation like the ones we have been solving and end up with a radical in the denominator, we may be expected to rationalize it as covered in . We will rationalize a denominator in the next example.    Solve for in .      The solution set is .    Recall that we have no meaning for the square root of a negative number. (Later we will give meaning to that idea, but for now it is meaningless). So if the solving process we are using leads to the square root of a negative number, the original equation has no real solution. Here is an example of an equation with no real solution.    Solve for in .     Since is not a real number, we say the equation has no real solution.      The Pythagorean Theorem  Right triangles have an important property called the Pythagorean Theorem .   The Pythagorean Theorem  Pythagorean theorem  For any right triangle, the lengths of the three sides have the following relationship: where and are the lengths of the shorter sides that meet the right angle (referred to as legs ), and is the length of the longest side (which is known as the hypotenuse ).   In a right triangle, the length of its three sides satisfy the equation    a right triangle with sides labeled a, b, and c; side c is the hypotenuse        Find the missing length in this right triangle.   A Right Triangle   a right triangle with a base of 5 units and a hypotenuse of 10 units;the height is labeled x       We will use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for : The missing length is .     Keisha is designing a wooden frame in the shape of a right triangle, as shown in . The legs of the triangle are  3  and  4  . How long should she make the diagonal side? Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.   According to Pythagorean Theorem, we have:      a right triangle with a base labeled a=3 ft; the height is labeled b=4 ft; the hypotenuse is labeled c      Now we have a quadratic equation that we need to solve. We need to find the number that has a square of . That is what the square root operation does. The diagonal side Keisha will cut is  5  long.  Note that is also a solution of because . But a length cannot be a negative number. We need to include both solutions when they are relevant, but also understand when some physical context makes one of the solutions nonsensical.    A ft ladder is leaning against a wall. The distance from the base of the ladder to the wall is feet. How high on the wall does the ladder reach?   The Pythagorean Theorem says: Now we need to isolate in order to solve for : We use the square root property. Because this is a geometric situation we only need to use the principal square root: Now simplify this radical and then approximate it:    Leaning Ladder   a right angle with a diagonal line for the ladder; the base of the triangle is labeled a=4.5 ft;the height of the triangle is labeled b; the hypotenuse is labeled c=16.5 ft      The ladder reaches about feet high on the wall.       Typically, how many solutions might there be with a quadratic equation?      When you see a sign, as in , is that saying that is both and ? Explain.      Have you memorized the Pythagorean Theorem?

Challenge     Imagine that you are in Math Land, where roads are perfectly straight, and Mathlanders can walk along a perfectly straight line between any two points. One day, you bike 6 miles west, 6 miles north, and 8 miles east. Then, your bike gets a flat tire and you have to walk home. How far do you have to walk?  You have to walk miles home.        You biked 6 miles west, 6 miles north, and 8 miles east. You are 6 miles north and 2 miles east of your home. These are two sides of a right triangle. Thus, you must use the Pythagorean Theorem to find out how far you walked home.  Solve this equation for           "

According to Pythagorean Theorem, we have:      a right triangle with a base labeled a=3 ft; the height is labeled b=4 ft; the hypotenuse is labeled c      Now we have a quadratic equation that we need to solve. We need to find the number that has a square of . That is what the square root operation does. The diagonal side Keisha will cut is  5  long.  Note that is also a solution of because . But a length cannot be a negative number. We need to include both solutions when they are relevant, but also understand when some physical context makes one of the solutions nonsensical.  "

  "title": "The Quadratic Formula",
  "body": " The Quadratic Formula   In , we solved certain quadratic equations using the square root property. This worked when the equations were in the right format where it was possible to use a square root radical. Now we learn another method to solve quadratic equations in general: the quadratic formula.   Alternative Video Lesson      Solving Quadratic Equations with the Quadratic Formula  The standard form for a quadratic equation is where is some nonzero number.  When and the equation's form is , then we can simply use the square root property to solve it as we did with equations like this in . But can we solve equations where ? A general method for doing this is to use the quadratic formula .   The Quadratic Formula  solving quadratic equations quadratic formula  For any quadratic equation with , the solutions are given by    As we have seen from solving quadratic equations in , there can be two solutions to a quadratic equation. Both solutions are represented in the quadratic formula because of the symbol. We could write the two solutions separately:   This method for solving quadratic equations will work to solve every quadratic equation. It is most helpful when .    Linh is in a physics class that launches a tennis ball from a rooftop that is feet above the ground. They fire it directly upward at a speed of feet per second and measure the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground below. We can model the height of the tennis ball, , in feet, with the quadratic equation , where represents the time in seconds after the launch. According to the model, when should the ball hit the ground?  The ground has height feet, so we should substitute in for . This gives us the quadratic equation: We cannot solve this equation with the square root property, so we will use the quadratic formula. First we will identify , , and , and substitute these into the quadratic formula: These are the exact solutions, but because we have a physical context we want to approximate the solutions with decimals. We don't use the negative solution because a negative time does not make sense in this context. The ball will hit the ground approximately seconds after it is launched.    The quadratic formula can be used to solve any quadratic equation, but it requires that you remembering the formula correctly and that you correctly identify , , and . Also, that you don't make any arithmetic mistakes when you simplify. We recommend that you always check if you could use the square root property before using the quadratic formula.    Solve for in .    First, we check and see that we cannot use the square root property (because ) so we will use the quadratic formula. We identify , , and . Substituting these into the quadratic formula: This is fully simplified because we cannot simplify or reduce the fraction. The solution set is . In this exercise, there is no reason to approximate these with decimals.    When a quadratic equation does not start out in standard form we must convert it to standard form before we can clearly identify the values of , , and .    Solve for in .    First, we convert the equation into standard form by adding and to each side of the equation: Next, we check that we cannot use the square root property so we will use the quadratic formula. We identify , and . Substituting them into the quadratic formula: We notice that the radical can be simplified: The solution set is .     The irrational solutions to quadratic equations can be checked, but doing this sometimes takes a lot of simplification and is not shown throughout this section. As an example of how much effort goes into a direct check, we will check the solution of from . We need to replace with and check that the two sides of the equation are equal. This check is shown here: It worked, and it took a lot of effort. As an alternative, we could use a calculator to find and see if this decimal approximation appears to be close to working. These are close. So with the help of a calculator, checking like this can give reasonable confidence that the solution we found is valid.   The radicand from the quadratic formula, , is called the discriminant . When it is a negative number, the quadratic equation has no real discriminant solution.    Solve for in .    Identify , and . Substitute them into the quadratic formula: The discriminant worked out to be , which is negative. The square root of a negative number is not a real number, so we will conclude that this equation has no real solutions.      Applications  Certain word problems lead to a quadratic equation where the quadratic formula may be useful.    A rectangle is inches longer than it is wide. The total area of the rectangle is 60 square inches. How wide is the rectangle? (This is asking for the shorter dimension.)    The area of a rectangle is given by multipying its two dimensions. If we let stand for the width of the rectangle (the shorter dimension), then is the length, and the total area is . A diagram can help make more clear what needs to be done.     So we must solve the equation . After multiplying and moving to standard form, we have . Using the quadratic formula: Only the solution makes sense as the width of a rectangle. So the rectangle is about inches wide.       Two numbers have sum and their product is Find these two numbers.        Let be one of these numbers. Since the two numbers have sum it means that the other number must be Since the two numbers have product we have the equation   This is a quadratic equation which can be rewritten into standard form by adding to each side:   Then, to solve for we apply the quadratic formula:   So the two possible solutions for are:   Actually these are the two numbers we were looking for. They sum to and multiply to          Amita has a food stand where she sells momo (Nepali dumplings). If she charges dollars for each momo, she estimates that she'd sell over the course of a year. (This reflects how raising the price can lead to fewer people making purchases.) What is the largest price that Amita could set to end up with a revenue of for the year? (Note that revenue is not the same as profit, and we will not be accounting for Amita's expenses.)       If Amita sets the price at dollars per momo, her total revenue will be , which is , which simplifies to . We have been asked to set that equal to . So many zeros! We have the option to divide by .  The possible solutions are about and . They are both valid solutions. Amita can reach the target revenue of by setting the price per momo to either or .      Radical Equations  Sometimes a radical equation gives rise to a quadratic equation, and the quadratic formula can then be useful.    Solve for in .    We will isolate the radical first, and then square both sides.  There was a step in this process where we squared both sides of an equation. Squaring both sides of an equation can cause false equations to become true. For example is false, but if you square both sides then is true. This means that when an equation solving process involves squaring both sides, and we end up with solutions like the two -values above, they are only potential solutions. Logically we've whittled down the list of possible solutions to just these two numbers. But we need to actually check whether or not they actually work. It turned out that is an extraneous solution , but is a valid solution. So the equation has one solution, , and the solution set is .      Solve the equation for .    We cannot isolate two radicals at the same time. One of the radicals is already isolated, so we will simply square both sides and then try to clean up what remains. Note here that we can leave the factor of next to the radical. We will square the also.   So our two potential solutions are and . We should now verify that they truly are solutions. So, is the only solution. The solution set is .        What is the formula for the discriminant?      Are there any kinds of quadratic equations where the quadratic formula is not the best tool to use?      Given a quadratic equation, will the quadratic formula always lead you to two solutions?

We can model the height of the tennis ball, , in feet, with the quadratic equation , where represents the time in seconds after the launch. According to the model, when should the ball hit the ground?  The ground has height feet, so we should substitute in for .

The area of a rectangle is given by multipying its two dimensions. If we let stand for the width of the rectangle (the shorter dimension), then is the length, and the total area is . A diagram can help make more clear what needs to be done.     So we must solve the equation . After multiplying and moving to standard form, we have . Using the quadratic formula: Only the solution makes sense as the width of a rectangle. So the rectangle is about inches wide.   "

  "body": " Key Features of Quadratic Graphs     Alternative Video Lesson    In this section we will learn about quadratic graphs and their key features, including vertex, axis of symmetry and intercepts.    Properties of Quadratic Graphs  Hannah fired a toy rocket from the ground, which launched into the air with an initial speed of feet per second. The height of the rocket can be modeled by the equation , where is how many seconds had passed since the launch. To see the shape of the graph made by this equation, we make a table of values and plot the points.    Points for         Point                                              Graph of   a coordinate plane with a U-shaped graph that opens downward. The parabola starts at (0,0) and goes up through the point (1,48) until it reaches (2,64) when it starts going down through (3,48) and stops at (4,0)      A curve with the shape that we see in Figure is called a parabola . Notice the symmetry in Figure , how the -values in rows above the middle row match those below the middle row. Also notice the symmetry in the shape of the graph, how its left side is a mirror image of its right side.  The first feature that we will talk about is the direction that a parabola opens. All parabolas open either upward or downward. This parabola in the rocket example opens downward because is negative. That means that for large values of , the term will be large and negative, and the resulting -value will be low on the -axis. So the negative leading coefficient causes the arms of the parabola to point downward.  Here are some more quadratic graphs so we can see which way they open.    The graph of opens upward. Its leading coefficient is positive.   a U-shaped graph opening upward      The graph of opens downward. Its leading coefficient is negative.   a wide U-shaped graph that opens downward      The graph of opens upward. Its leading coefficient is positive.   a narrow U-shaped graph that opens upward       The graph of a quadratic equation opens upward or downward according to the sign of the leading coefficient . If the leading coefficient is positive, the parabola opens upward. If the leading coefficient is negative, the parabola opens downward. parabola opening up or down       Determine whether each quadratic graph opens upward or downward.   The graph of opens  upward   downward  .    The graph of opens  upward   downward  .    The graph of opens  upward   downward  .    The graph of opens  upward   downward  .                           The graph of opens upward as the leading coefficient is the positive number    The graph of opens downward as the leading coefficient is the negative number    The graph of opens downward as the leading coefficient is (Note that the leading coefficient is the coefficient on )    The graph of opens upward as the leading coefficient is the positive number          The vertex  vertex  parabola vertex of a quadratic graph is the highest or lowest point on the graph, depending on whether the graph opens downward or upward. In Figure , the vertex is . This tells us that Hannah's rocket reached its maximum height of feet after seconds. If the parabola opens downward, as in the rocket example, then the -value of the vertex is the maximum  maximum  -value. If the parabola opens upward then the -value of the vertex is the minimum  minimum  -value.   The axis of symmetry  axis of symmetry  parabola axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, cutting the quadratic graph into two symmetric halves. We write the axis of symmetry as an equation of a vertical line so it always starts with . In Figure , the equation for the axis of symmetry is .  The vertical intercept  parabola vertical intercept is the point where the parabola crosses the vertical axis. The vertical intercept is the -intercept if the vertical axis is labeled . In Figure , the point is the starting point of the rocket, and it is where the graph crosses the -axis, so it is the vertical intercept. The -value of means the rocket was on the ground when the -value was , which was when the rocket launched.  The horizontal intercept(s)  parabola horizontal intercept are the points where the parabola crosses the horizontal axis. They are the -intercepts if the horizontal axis is labeled . The point on the path of the rocket is also a horizontal intercept. The -value of indicates the time when the rocket was launched from the ground. There is another horizontal intercept at the point , which means the rocket came back to hit the ground after seconds.  It is possible for a quadratic graph to have zero, one, or two horizontal intercepts. The figures below show an example of each.    The graph of has no horizontal intercepts   a U-shaped graph that opens upward and is above the x-axis; there are no horizontal intercepts      The graph of has one horizontal intercept   a wide U-shaped graph that opens downward and has its vertex on the x-axis so there is one x-intercept      The graph of has two horizontal intercepts   a narrow U-shaped graph that has its vertex below the x-axis and opens upward so there are two x-intercepts      Here is a summary of the key features of quadratic graphs.   Summary of Key Features of Quadratic Graphs   Consider a quadratic equation in the form and the parabola that it makes when graphed.     Direction  The parabola opens upward if is positive and opens downward of is negative.    Vertex  The vertex of the parabola is the maximum or minimum point on the graph.    Axis of Symmetry  The axis of symmetry is the vertical line that passes through the vertex.    Vertical Intercept  The vertical intercept is the point where the graph intersects the vertical axis. There is exactly one vertical intercept.    Horizontal Intercept(s)  The horizontal intercept(s) are the point(s) where a graph intersects the horizontal axis. The graph of a parabola can have zero, one, or two horizontal intercepts.       Identify the key features of the quadratic graph of shown in Figure .      First, we see that this parabola opens upward because the leading coefficient is positive.  Then we locate the vertex which is the point . The axis of symmetry is the vertical line .  The vertical intercept or -intercept is the point .  The horizontal intercepts are the points and .    Graph of   the graph of a parabola that opens upward, has a vertex at (-1,9), a y-intercept at (0,-8) and x-intercepts at (-2,0) and (4,0)           Use the graph to answer the following questions.      What are the coordinates of the vertex?    What is the equation of the axis of symmetry?    What are the coordinates of the -intercept(s)?    What are the coordinates of the -intercept?                           The vertex is at    The equation of the axis of symmetry is    There are no -intercepts. (Answer None .)    The -intercept is at            Finding the Vertex and Axis of Symmetry Algebraically  The coordinates of the vertex are not easy to identify on a graph if they are not integers Another way to find the coordinates of the vertex is by using a formula.   Vertex Formula  If we denote as the coordinates of the vertex of a quadratic graph defined by , then . Then we can find by substituting in for . quadratic vertex    To understand why, we can look at the quadratic formula . The vertex is on the axis of symmetry, so it will always occur halfway between the two -intercepts (if there are any). The quadratic formula shows that the -intercepts happen at minus some number and at plus that same number. So is right in the middle, and it must be the horizontal coordinate of the vertex, . If we have already memorized the quadratic formula, this new formula for is not hard to remember:    Determine the vertex and axis of symmetry of the parabola .  We find the first coordinate of the vertex using the formula , for and .   Now we know the first coordinate of the vertex is , so we may substitute to determine the second coordinate of the vertex: The vertex is the point and the axis of symmetry is the line .     Determine the vertex and axis of symmetry of the parabola .    Using the formula with and , we have :   Now that we've determined , we can substitute it for to find the -value of the vertex: The vertex is the point and the axis of symmetry is the line .      Graphing Quadratic Equations by Making a Table  When we learned how to graph lines, we could choose any -values to build a table of values. For quadratic equations, we want to make sure the vertex is present in the table, since it is such a special point. So we find the vertex first and then choose our -values surrounding it. We can use the property of symmetry to speed things up.    Determine the vertex and axis of symmetry for the parabola . Then make a table of values and sketch the graph.    To determine the vertex of , we want to find the -value of the vertex first. We use with and : To find the -coordinate of the vertex, we substitute into the equation for our parabola. Now we know that our axis of symmetry is the line and the vertex is the point . We set up our table with two values on each side of . We choose , , , , and as shown in Figure .  Next, we determine the -coordinates by replacing with each value and we have the complete table as shown in Figure . Notice that each pair of -values on either side of the vertex match. This helps us to check that our vertex and -values are correct.    Setting up the table         Point                               Values and points for          Point                                    Now that we have our table, we plot the points and draw in the axis of symmetry as shown in Figure . We complete the graph by drawing a smooth curve through the points and drawing an arrow on each end as shown in Figure .    Plot of the points and axis of symmetry   a coordinate plane with the points from the table plotted; the axis of symmetry is drawn as a vertical dotted line through the vertex      Graph of   the points from the previous graph are connected to make a smooth U-shaped parabola opening downward        The method we used works best when the -value of the vertex is an integer. We can still make a graph if that is not the case as we will demonstrate in the next example.    Determine the vertex and axis of symmetry for the parabola . Use this to create a table of values and sketch the graph.    To determine the vertex of , we find with and : Next, we determine the -coordinate by replacing with in : Thus the vertex occurs at , or at . The axis of symmetry is then the line , or . Now that we know the -value of the vertex, we create a table. We choose -values on both sides of , but we choose integers because it will be easier to find the -values.    Values and points for         Point                                              Plot of initial points   A coordinate plot with the points from the table plotted; the points are (-1,1), (0,-4), (0.75,-5.125), (1,-5), (2,-2); the axis of symmetry is drawn as a dotted line at y=0.75      The points graphed in Figure don't have the symmetry we'd expect from a parabola. This is because the vertex occurs at an -value that is not an integer, and all of the chosen values in the table are integers. We can use the axis of symmetry to determine more points on the graph (as shown in Figure ), which will give it the symmetry we expect. From there, we can complete the sketch of this graph.    Plot of symmetric points   The previous plot with symmetric points added; The points are (2.5,1), (1.5,-4), (0.5,-5), (-0.5,-2)      Graph of   The previous plot with all of the points connected by a smooth, U-shaped curve           Applications of Quadratic Graphs Involving the Vertex.  We looked at the height of Hannah's toy rocket with respect to time at the beginning of this section and saw that it reached a maximum height of feet after seconds. Let's look at some more applications that involve finding the minimum or maximum -value on a quadratic graph.    Jae got a new air rifle for target practice. The first thing they did with it was some testing to find out how accurate the targeting cross-hairs were. In Olympic -meter air rifle shooting , the bulls-eye is a  0.5  diameter dot, about the size of the head of a pin, so accuracy is key. To test the accuracy, Jae stood at certain specific distances from a bullseye target, aimed the cross-hairs on the bullseye, and fired. Jae recorded how far above or how far below the pellet hit relative to the bullseye.   Shooting Distance vs Pellet Rise\/Fall            Distance to Target in Yards           Above\/Below Bulls-eye           Distance Above\/Below in Inches            Make a graph of the height of the pellet relative to the bulls-eye at the shooting distances Jae used in Figure and find the vertex. What does the vertex mean in this context?      Note that values measured below the bulls-eye should be graphed as negative -values. Keep in mind that the units on the axes are different: along the -axis, the units are yards, whereas on the -axis, the units are inches.  Since the input values seem to be increasing by s or s, we scale the -axis by s. The -axis needs to be scaled by s.  From the graph we can see that the point is our best guess for the vertex. This means the highest above the cross-hairs Jae hit was inches when the target was yards away.    Graph of Target Data   a Cartesian grid with points (5,-0.1), (10,0.6),(20,1.1),(30,0.6),(35,0),(40,-0.8),(50,-3.2); the points are connected with a smooth U-shaped curve that opens downward          We looked at the quadratic equation in Example of Section , where was the revenue (in dollars) for 25-cent price increases from an initial price of $13. The expression simplified to . Find the vertex of this quadratic expression and explain what it means in the context of this model.    Note that if we tried to use , we would not be able to immediately identify the values of and needed to determine the vertex.

The following graph illustrates our findings.            You plan to build four identical rectangular animal enclosures in a row. Each adjacent pair of pens share a fence between them. You have a total of feet of fence to use. Find the dimensions of each pen such that you can enclose the maximum possible area. One approach is to let represent the length of fencing that adjacent pens share, and write a formula for a function of that outputs the total area. Then find its vertex and interpret it.  The length of each pen (along the walls that they share) should be , the width (perpendicular to the river) should be , and the maximum possible area of each pen is .                  Drawing a diagram should help us construct up a function for the area of the pen.   Let the width be ft, and the length be ft. Since there is a total of feet of fencing, we have:   If each pen's length is feet, then its width is feet. Now we can construct a function for the area of each pen:    In this formula, represents each pen's length in feet, and represents each pen's area in square feet. Identify that .  Each output of this function represents a possible area of each pen. The maximum area happens at this quadratic function's vertex.  To find the vertex, we first find the parabola's axis by the axis formula:   Next, we substitute into the rule for the function, and we have:   The parabola's vertex is at . This implies that each pen's maximum area is . This happens when the length is , and the width is , or .  So when the length is and the width is , each pen has a maximum area of .  The following graph illustrates our findings.              Currently, an artist can sell paintings every year at the price of per painting. Each time he raises the price per painting by , he sells fewer paintings every year.    To obtain maximum income of , the artist should set the price per painting at .    To earn per year, the artist could sell his paintings at two different prices. The lower price is per painting, and the higher price is per painting.                         Assume the artist will raise the price per painting times.  The current price per painting is . After raising the price times, each time by , the new price per painting will become dollars.  Currently he sells paintings per year. It s given that he will sell fewer paintings each time he raises the price. After raising the price per painting times, he will sell paintings every year.  The artist s income can be calculated by multiplying the number of paintings sold with price per painting. If he raises the price per painting times, his new yearly income can be modeled by the expression:   which gives his yearly income in dollars.  We can write this quadratic expression in standard form:   Written in standard form, we can see:    Part a:  The graph of is an upside-down parabola. The maximum income he can make is represented by the parabola s vertex. To locate its vertex, we first find its axis by the axis formula:   Next, we substitute into the expression to find its vertex s -value:   The vertex is at . This implies the artist can earn a maximum yearly income of . This happens if he increases the price per painting times, making the new price dollars.   Part b:  If the artist wants to make per year, we will set the expression representing income equal to , and we have:   Next, we can solve this quadratic equation with the Quadratic Formula. Identify that .   If the artist raises the price times, the new price would be dollars per painting.  If the artist raises the price times, the new price would be dollars per painting.  To earn per year, the artist could sell his paintings at two different prices. The lower price is per painting, and the higher price is dollars per painting.

  "body": " Graphing Quadratic Expressions    Alternative Video Lesson    We have learned how to visually locate the key features of quadratic graphs and how to find the vertex algebraically. In this section we'll explore how to find the intercepts algebraically and use their coordinates to more precisely graph a quadratic equation. Then we will see how to interpret the key features in context and distinguish between quadratic and other graphs.    Let's start by looking at a quadratic equation that models the path of a baseball after it is hit by Ignacio, the batter. The height of the baseball, , measured in feet, after seconds is given by . We know the graph will have the shape of a parabola and we want to know the initial height, the maximum height, and the amount of time it takes for the ball to hit the ground if it is not caught. These important ideas correspond to the vertical intercept, the vertex, and one of the horizontal intercepts.  The graph of this equation is shown in Figure . We cannot easily read where the intercepts occur from the graph because they are not integers. We previously covered how to determine the vertex algebraically. In this section, we'll learn how to find the intercepts algebraically. Then we'll come back to this example and find the intercepts for the path of the baseball.    Graph of   a graph of a parabola that opens downward; the x-intercepts are not integer values        Finding the Vertical and Horizontal Intercepts Algebraically  In List , we identified that the vertical intercept intercept vertical  vertical-intercept  intercept  -intercept occurs where the graph intersects the vertical axis. If we're using and as our variables, the -value on the vertical axis is . We can substitute for to find the value of .  The horizontal intercepts intercept horizontal  horizontal intercept  intercept  -intercept occur where the graph intersects the horizontal axis. If we're using and as our variables, the -value on the horizontal axis is , so we can substitute for and find the value(s) of .    Find the intercepts for the quadratic equation using algebra.  To determine the -intercept, we substitute and find . So the -intercept occurs where . On a graph, this is the point .  To determine the -intercept(s), we set and solve for :  The -intercepts occur where and where . On a graph, these are the points and .   Notice in Example that the -intercept was and the value of was . When we substitute for we will always get the value of .   The vertical intercept of a quadratic equation occurs at the point where is the constant term, because substituting leaves only the constant term.      Algebraically determine any horizontal and vertical intercepts of the quadratic equation .    To determine the vertical intercept, take the constant term , and recognize that the -intercept is at the point .  To determine the horizontal intercepts, we'll set and solve for : The radicand is negative so there are no real solutions to the equation. This means there are no horizontal intercepts.      Graphing Quadratic Equations Using Their Key Features  To graph a quadratic equation using its key features, we can use algebra to determine the following: whether the parabola opens upward or downward, the vertical intercept, the horizontal intercepts and the vertex. Then we can graph the points and connect them with a smooth curve.    Graph the quadratic equation by algebraically determining its key features.  To start, we'll note that this parabola will open upward, since the leading coefficient is positive.  To find the -intercept, we substitute to find . The -intercept is .  Next, we'll find the horizontal intercepts by setting and solving for :   The -intercepts are and .  Lastly, we'll determine the vertex.

Here are some applications of quadratic equations so we can learn how to identify and interpret the vertex, intercepts and additional points in context.     Returning to the path of the baseball in Figure , the equation that represents the height of the baseball after Ignacio hit it, is . The height is in feet and the time, , is in seconds. Find and interpret the following, in context.   The vertical intercept.    The horizontal intercept(s).    The vertex.    The height of the baseball second after it was hit.    The time(s) when the baseball is feet above the ground.          To determine the vertical intercept, we'll substitute to find . The vertical intercept occurs at . This is the height of the baseball at time , so the initial height of the baseball was feet.    To determine the horizontal intercepts, we'll solve .  Rounding these two values with a calculator, we obtain: The horizontal intercepts occur at approximately and . If we assume that the ball was hit when , a negative time does not make sense. The second horizontal intercept tells us that the ball hit the ground after approximately seconds.    The vertex occurs at , and for this equation and . So we have: And then we can find the vertex's second coordinate: Thus the vertex is about .  The vertex tells us that the baseball reached a maximum height of approximately feet about seconds after Ignacio hit it.    To find the height of the baseball after second, we can compute when : The height of the baseball was feet after second.    If we want to know when the baseball was feet in the air, then we set and we have:  Rounding these two values with a calculator, we obtain: The baseball was feet above the ground at two times, at about seconds on the way up and about seconds on the way down.          The profit that Keenan's manufacturing company makes for producing refrigerators is given by , for .   Determine the profit the company will make when they produce refrigerators.    Determine the maximum profit and the number of refrigerators produced that yields this profit.    How many refrigerators need to be produced in order for the company to break even? (In other words, for their profit to be .)    How many refrigerators need to be produced in order for the company to make a profit of ?          This question is giving us an input value and asking for the output value. We substitute for and we have: If Keenan's company sells refrigerators it will make a profit of .    This question is asking for the maximum, so we need to find the vertex. This parabola opens downward so the vertex will tell us the maximum profit and the corresponding number of refrigerators that need to be produced. Using and , we have: Now we find the value of when : The maximum profit is , which occurs if units are produced.    This question is giving a height of and asking us to find the time(s). So we will be finding the horizontal intercept(s). We set and solve for using the quadratic formula: The company will break even if they produce about refrigerators or refrigerators. If the company produces more refrigerators than it can sell its profit will go down.    This question is giving us the profit value. We set and solve for using the quadratic formula: The company will make in profit if they produce about refrigerators or refrigerators.          Maia has a remote-controlled airplane and she is going to do a stunt dive where the plane dives toward the ground and back up along a parabolic path.

Determine the height of the plane after seconds.    Will the plane hit the ground, and if so, at what time?    If the plane does not hit the ground, what is the closest it gets to the ground, and at what time?    At what time(s) will the plane have a height of feet?          This question is asking for the starting height which is the vertical intercept. So we find when : When Maia begins the stunt, the plane has a height of feet. Recall that we can also look at the value of to determine the vertical intercept.    This question is telling us to use and find : After seconds, the plane is feet above the ground.    The ground has a height of feet, so it is asking us to find the horizontal intercept(s) if there are any. We set and solve for using the quadratic formula: The radicand is negative so there are no real solutions to the equation . That means the plane did not hit the ground.    This question is asking for the lowest point of the airplane so we should find the vertex. Using and , we have: Now we can find the value of when : The minimum height of the plane is about feet, which occurs after about seconds.    This question is giving us a height and asking for the corresponding time(s) so we set and solve for using the quadratic formula: Maia's plane will be feet above the ground about 9 seconds and 24 seconds after the plane begins the stunt.          Distinguishing Quadratic Equations from Other Equations  So far, we've seen that the graphs of quadratic equations are parabolas and have a specific curved with a vertex. We've also seen that they have the algebraic form of . Here, we practice recognizing a quadratic equation so that we can call to mind that the equation has these features, which may be useful in some application.    Determine if each equation is a quadratic equation.                                  As can be re-written as , this equation is a quadratic equation.    The equation cannot be re-written in the form (due to the term), so this equation is not a quadratic equation.    The equation is a linear equation, not a quadratic equation.    The equation can be re-written as , so this is a quadratic equation.    The equation is not a quadratic equation as is inside a radical, not squared.

We will also see how parabola graphs can be shifted.   Alternative Video Lessons        Exploring Quadratic Functions with Graphing Technology  Graphing technology is very important and useful for applications and for finding points quickly. Let's explore some quadratic functions with graphing technology.    Use technology to graph and make a table of the quadratic function defined by and find each of the key points or features.   Find the vertex.    Find the vertical intercept ( -intercept).    Find the horizontal or ( -intercept(s)).    Find .    Solve using the graph.    Solve using the graph.     State the domain and range of the function.        The specifics of how to use any one particular technology tool vary. Whether you use an app, a physical calculator, or something else, a table and graph should look like:                             the graph of the parabola f(x)=2x^2+4x-3, that opens upward, passing through the points listed in the table      Additional features of your technology tool can enhance the graph to help answer these questions. You may be able to make the graph appear like:   the previous graph with all of the key points labeled as described below        The vertex is .    The vertical intercept is .    The horizontal intercepts are approximately and .    When , , so .    The solutions to are the -values where . We graph the horizontal line and find the -values where the graphs intersect. The solution set is .    The solutions are all of the -values where the function's graph is below (or touching) the line . The interval is .     The domain is and the range is .       Now we will look at an application with graphing technology and put the points of interest in context.    A reduced-gravity aircraft is a fixed-wing airplane that astronauts use for training. The airplane flies up and then down in a parabolic path to simulate the feeling of weightlessness. In one training flight, the pilot will fly to parabolic maneuvers.  For the first parabolic maneuver, the altitude of the plane, in feet, at time , in seconds since the maneuver began, is given by .   Determine the starting altitude of the plane for the first maneuver.    What is the altitude of the plane seconds into the maneuver?    Determine the maximum altitude of the plane and how long it takes to reach that altitude.    The zero-gravity effect is experienced when the plane begins the parabolic path until it gets back down to feet. Write an inequality to express this and solve it using the graph. Write the times of the zero-gravity effect as an interval and determine how long the astronauts experience weightlessness during each cycle.    Use technology to make a table for with -values from to seconds. Use an increment of seconds and then use the table to solve .    State the domain and range for this context.       We can answer the questions based on the information in the graph.   Graph of with   a graph of the parabola y=-16t^2+400t+30500 and the horizontal line y=30500; the parabola opens downward and has a maximum at (12.5, 33000)        The starting altitude can be read from the vertical intercept, which is . The feeling of weightlessness begins at feet.    After seconds, the altitude of the plane is feet.    For the maximum altitude of the plane we look at the vertex, which is approximately . This tells us that after seconds the plane will be at its maximum altitude of feet.    We can write an inequality to describe when the plane is at or above feet and solve it graphically. . We graph the line and find the points of intersection with the parabola. The astronauts experience weightlessness from seconds to seconds into the maneuver, or seconds. They experience weightlessness for 25 seconds in each cycle.    To solve using the table, we look for where the -values are equal to .                                    There are two solutions, seconds and seconds. The solution set is .    When we use technology we see the entire function but in this context the plane is only on a parabolic path from to seconds. So the domain is , and the range is the set of corresponding -values which is feet.       Let's look at the remote-controlled airplane dive from Example . This time we will use technology to answer the questions.      Maia has a remote-controlled airplane and she is going to do a stunt dive where the plane dives toward the ground and back up along a parabolic path. The altitude or height of the plane is given by the function where , for . The height is measured in feet and the time, , is measured in seconds since the stunt began.   Determine the starting height of the plane as the dive begins.    Determine the height of the plane after seconds.    Will the plane hit the ground, and if so, at what time?    If the plane does not hit the ground, what is the closest it gets to the ground, and at what time?    At what time(s) will the plane have an altitude of feet?    State the domain and the range of the function (in context).       We have graphed the function and we will find the key information and put it in context.   Graph of   a graph of the quadratic function with all of the key features labeled that are described below        The starting altitude can be read from the vertical intercept, which is . When the stunt begins, the plane has a altitude of feet.    When , the -value is . So . This means that after seconds, the plane is feet above the ground.    From the graph we can see that the parabola does not touch or cross the -axis, which represents the ground. This means the plane does not hit the ground and there are no real solutions to the equation .    The lowest point is the vertex, which is approximately . The minimum altitude of the plane is about feet, which occurs after about seconds.    We graph the horizontal line and look for the points of intersection. The plane will be feet above the ground about seconds after the plane begins the stunt, and again at about seconds.    The domain for this function is given in the problem statement because only part of the parabola represents the path of the plane. The domain is . For the range we look at the possible altitudes of the plane and see that it is . The plane is doing this stunt from to seconds and its height ranges from about to feet above the ground.         The Vertex Form of a Parabola  We have learned the standard form of a quadratic function's formula, which is . In this subsection, we will learn another form called the vertex form .  Using graphing technology, consider the graphs of and on the same axes.   We see only one parabola because these are two different forms of the same function. Indeed, if we convert into standard form: it is clear that and are the same function.   Graph of and   the graphs of the two parabolas overlap each other completely      The formula given for is said to be in vertex form because it allows us to read the vertex without doing any calculations. The vertex of the parabola is . We can see those numbers in . The -value is the solution to , and the -value is the constant added at the end.  Here are the graphs of three more functions with formulas in vertex form. Compare each function with the vertex of its graph.      the graph of a parabola that opens upward and has a vertex at (2,1)        the graph of a wide parabola that opens downward and has a vertex at (-1,3)        the graph of a narrow parabola that opens upward and has a vertex at (-3,-3.5)      Notice that the -coordinate of the vertex has the opposite sign as the value in the function formula. On the other hand, the -coordinate of the vertex has the same sign as the value in the function formula. Let's look at an example to understand why. We will evaluate . The -value is the solution to , which is positive . When we substitute for we get the value . Note that these coordinates create the vertex at . Now we can define the vertex form of a quadratic function.   Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function  vertex form of a quadratic function  quadratic function vertex form   A quadratic function with the vertex at the point is given by .        Find the vertex of each quadratic function.                                      The vertex of is    The vertex of is    The vertex of is    The vertex of is          Now let's do the reverse. When given the vertex and the value of , we can write the function in vertex form.      Write a formula for the quadratic function with the given vertex and value of .   Vertex ,     Vertex ,     Vertex ,     Vertex ,           The vertex form is .    The vertex form is .    The vertex form is .    The vertex form is .        Once we read the vertex we can also state the domain and range. All quadratic functions have a domain of because we can put in any value to a quadratic function. The range, however, depends on the -value of the vertex and whether the parabola opens upward or downward. When we have a quadratic function in vertex form we can read the range from the formula. Let's look at the graph of , where , as an example.   The graph of   the graph of a parabola that opens upward with a vertex of (3,-5)       The domain is . The graph of opens upward (which we know because is positive) so the vertex is the minimum point. The -value of is the minimum. The range is .    Identify the domain and range of , where .        the graph of a parabola that opens downward with a vertex of (-1,6)      The domain is . The graph of opens downward (which we know because is negative) so the vertex is the maximum point. The -value of is the maximum. The range is .        Identify the domain and range of each quadratic function.    The domain is and the range is .     The domain is and the range is .     The domain is and the range is .     The domain is and the range is .                                               The domain of is The parabola opens downward so the range is    The domain of is The parabola opens upward so the range is    The domain of is The parabola opens downward so the range is    The domain of is The parabola opens upward so the range is                Horizontal and Vertical Shifts  Let and . The graph of has its vertex at the point . Now we will compare this with the graph of on the same axes.    The graph of and   the graph of two identical parabolas that open upward; one has a vertex at (0,0) and the other one is shifted to the right by 4 units and up by one unit so it's vertex is at (4,1)     Both graphs open upward and have the same shape. Notice that the graph of is the same as the graph of but is shifted to the right by units and up by units because its vertex is .   Let's look at another graph. Let and let .    The graph of and   the graph of two identical parabolas that open downward; one has a vertex at (0,0) and the other is shifted to the left by 3 units and up by 4 units to have a vertex at (-3,4)     Both parabolas open downward and have the same shape. The graph of is the same as the graph of but it has been shifted to the left by units and up by units making its vertex .   To summarize, when a quadratic function is written in vertex form , the -value is the horizontal shift of its graph from the graph of and the -value is the vertical shift of its graph from the graph of .       Identify the horizontal and vertical shifts compared with .                             The graph of has vertex at . Therefore the graph is the same as shifted to the left units and up units.    The graph of has vertex at . Therefore the graph is the same as shifted to the right unit and up units.    The graph of has vertex at . Therefore the graph is the same as shifted to the right units and down unit.    The graph of has vertex at . Therefore the graph is the same as shifted to the left units and down units.         The Factored Form of a Parabola  There is another form of a quadratic function's formula, called factored form , which we will explore next. Let's consider the two functions and . Using graphing technology, we will graph and on the same axes.   These graphs coincide because the functions are actually the same. We can tell by multiplying out the formula for to get back to the formula for . Now we can see that and are really the same function.   Graph of and   the graph of two identical parabolas that open downward and overlap each other completely      Factored form is very useful because we can read the -intercepts directly from the function, which in this case are and . We find these by looking for the values that make the factors equal to , so the -values have the opposite signs as are shown in the formula. To demonstrate this, we will find the roots by solving .  This shows us that the -intercepts are and .  The -values of the -intercepts are also called zeros or roots . zeros of a function  roots of a function The zeros or roots of the function are and .

Write the horizontal intercepts of each function.                                      The horizontal intercepts of are and    The horizontal intercepts of are and    The horizontal intercepts of are and    The horizontal intercepts of are and          Let's summarize the three forms of a quadratic function's formula:   Standard Form   , with -intercept .    Vertex Form   , with vertex .    Factored Form   , with -intercepts and .    quadratic function forms       With the vertex form of a quadratic function, the formula shows you a point on the graph (without having to do any calculation). What is the name of that point?      With the standard form of a quadratic function, the formula shows you a point on the graph (without having to do any calculation). What is the name of that point?      What makes the vertex form of a quadratic function nicer for graphing compared to standard form?

This topic is useful for solving quadratic equations and putting quadratic functions in vertex form.   Alternative Video Lessons      Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square  solving quadratic equations by completing the square  When we have an equation like , we can solve it quickly using the square root property :  The method of completing the square  completing the square allows us to solve any quadratic equation using the square root property.  Suppose you have a small quadratic expression in the form . It can be visualized as an L -shape as in Figure .         The missing square in the upper right corner of Figure is on each side, so its area is . This means that if we have and add , we are completing the larger square.   The Term that Completes the Square  completing the square   For a polynomial , the constant term needed to make a perfect square trinomial is .     Completing the Square  completing the square  solving quadratic equations by completing the square   For a quadratic equation simplified to the form , to solve for by completing the square,   Use Fact to find the number to add to both sides of the equation to make the left hand side a perfect square. This number is always .    Add that number to both sides of to get     The left hand side is now a perfect square that factors as , so the equation becomes     Solve remaining equation using the .         Solve the quadratic equation by completing the square.    To solve the quadratic equation , on the left side we can complete the square by adding ; note that in this case, which makes . We add it to both sides to maintain equality. Now that we have completed the square, we can solve the equation using the square root property. The solution set is .    Now let's see the process for completing the square when the quadratic equation is given in standard form.    Solve by completing the square.    We see that the polynomial on the left side is not a perfect square trinomial, so we need to complete the square. We subtract from both sides so we can add the missing term on the left. Next comes the completing-the-square step. We need to add the correct number to both sides of the equation to make the left side a perfect square. Remember that Fact states that we need to use for this. In our case, , so   The solution set is .       Complete the square to solve for in        To complete the square, first move the constant term to the right side of the equation. Then use Fact 3 to find to add to both sides.   In our case, so    The solution set is        So far, the value of has been even each time, which makes a whole number. When is odd, we end up adding a fraction to both sides. Here is an example.    Complete the square to solve for in .    First move the constant term to the right side of the equation: Next, to complete the square, we need to find the right number to add to both sides. According to Fact , we need to divide the value of by and then square the result to find the right number. First, divide by : and then we square that result: Now we can add the from Equation to both sides of the equation to complete the square. Now, to factor the seemingly complicated expression on the left, just know that it should always factor using the number from the first step in the completing the square process, Equation .  The solution set is .    In each of the previous examples, the value of was equal to . This is necessary for our missing term formula to work. When is not equal to we will divide both sides by . Let's look at an example of that.    Solve for in by completing the square.    Because there is a leading coefficient of , we divide both sides by . Next, we complete the square. Since , first, and next, squaring that, we have . So we add from Equation to both sides of the equation: Here, remember that we always factor with the number found in the first step of completing the square, Equation .  The solution set is .      Deriving the Quadratic Formula by Completing the Square  In Section , we learned the Quadratic Formula. You may have wondered where the formula comes from, and now that we know how to complete the square, we can derive it. We will solve the standard form equation for .  First, we subtract from both sides and divide both sides by . Next, we complete the square by taking half of the middle coefficient and squaring it. First, and then squaring that we have We add the from Equation to both sides of the equation: Remember that the left side always factors with the value we found in Equation . So we have: To find a common denominator on the right, we multiply by in the numerator and denominator on the second term.    Now that we have completed the square, we can see that the -value of the vertex is . That is the vertex formula. Next, we solve the equation using the square root property to find the Quadratic Formula.     This shows us that the solutions to the equation are .    Putting Quadratic Functions in Vertex Form  In Section , we learned about the vertex form of a parabola, which allows us to quickly read the coordinates of the vertex. We can now use the method of completing the square to put a quadratic function in vertex form. Completing the square with a function is a little different than with an equation so we will start with an example.    Write a formula in vertex form for the function defined by     The formula is in the form , so we need to add to complete the square by Fact . When we had an equation, we could add the same quantity to both sides. But now we do not wish to change the left side, since we are trying to end up with a formula that still says . Instead, we add and subtract the term from the right side in order to maintain equality. In this case, To maintain equality, we both add and subtract on the same side of the equation. It is functionally the same as adding on the right, but the makes it possible to factor the expression in a particular way:    Now that we have completed the square, our function is in vertex form. The vertex is . One way to verify that our work is correct is to graph the original version of the function and check that the vertex is where it should be.   Graph of   a plot of y=x^2+8x with the vertex labeled at (-4,-16)        Let's look at a function that has a constant term and see how to complete the square.    Write a formula in vertex form for the function defined by     To complete the square, we need to add and subtract on the right side. The vertex is .    In the first two examples, was equal to . When is not equal to one, we have an additional step. Since we are working with an expression where we intend to preserve the left side as , we cannot divide both sides by . Instead we factor out of the first two terms. Let's look at an example of that.    Write a formula in vertex form for the function defined by     Before we can complete the square, we factor the out of the first two terms. Now we complete the square inside the parentheses by adding and subtracting . Notice that the constant that we subtracted is inside the parentheses, but it will not be part of our perfect square trinomial. In order to bring it outside, we need to multiply it by . We are distributing the to that term so we can combine it with the outside term. The vertex is .    Here is an example that includes fractions.    Write a formula in vertex form for the function defined by     First, we factor the leading coefficient out of the first two terms. Next, we complete the square for inside the grouping symbols by adding and subtracting the right number. To find that number, we divide the value of by two and square the result. That looks like: and then, Adding and subtracting the value from Equation , we have: Remember that when completing the square, the expression should always factor with the number found in the first step of the completing-the-square process, Equation . The vertex is .    Completing the square can also be used to find a minimum or maximum in an application.    In Example , we learned that artist Tyrone's annual income from paintings can be modeled by , where is the number of times he will raise the price per painting by $20.00. To maximize his income, how should Tyrone set his price per painting? Find the maximum by completing the square.    To find the maximum is essentially the same as finding the vertex, which we can find by completing the square. To complete the square for , we start by factoring out the from the first two terms: Next, we complete the square for by adding and subtracting . The vertex is the point . This implies Tyrone should raise the price per painting times, which is dollars. He would sell paintings. This would make the price per painting dollars, and his annual income from paintings would become $22,500 by this model.       Graphing Quadratic Functions by Hand  Now that we know how to put a quadratic function in vertex form, let's review how to graph a parabola by hand.     Graph the function defined by by determining its key features algebraically.    To start, we'll note that this function opens upward because the leading coefficient, , is positive.  Now we may complete the square to find the vertex. We factor the out of the first two terms, and then add and subtract on the right side. The vertex is so the axis of symmetry is the line .  To find the -intercept, we'll replace with or read the value of from the function in standard form: The -intercept is and we can find its symmetric point on the graph, which is .  Next, we'll find the horizontal intercepts. We see this function factors so we write the factored form to get the horizontal intercepts. The -intercepts are and .  Now we plot all of the key points and draw the parabola.   The graph of .   a graph of the parabola y=2x^2+4x-6 opens upward and the key features are labeled;the vertex is (-1,-8);the axis of symmetry is drawn at x=-1;the y-intercept is (0,-6) and its symmetric point is (-2,-6);the x-intercepts are (1,0) and (-3,0)         Write a formula in vertex form for the function defined by , and find the graph's key features algebraically. Then sketch the graph.    In this function, the leading coefficient is negative so it will open downward. To complete the square we first factor out of the first two terms. Now, we add and subtract the correct number on the right side of the function: . The vertex is so the axis of symmetry is the line .  We find the -intercept by looking at the value of , which is . So, the -intercept is and we can find its symmetric point on the graph, .  The original expression, , does not factor so to find the -intercepts we need to set and complete the square or use the quadratic formula. Since we just went through the process of completing the square above, we can use that result to save several repetitive steps.  The -intercepts are approximately and . Now we can plot all of the points and draw the parabola.   The graph of .   a graph of the parabola y=-x^2-4x-1 opens downward and the key features are labeled;the vertex is (-2,3);the axis of symmetry is drawn at x=-2;the y-intercept is (0,-1) and its symmetric point is (-4,-1);the x-intercepts are (-3.7,0) and (-0.3,0)           For the expression , explain in words what is the next step to complete the square.

  "body": " Introduction to Rational Functions   In this chapter we will learn about rational functions, which are ratios of two polynomial functions. Creating this ratio inherently requires division, and we'll explore the effect this has on the graphs of rational functions and their domain and range.   Alternative Video Lesson      Graphs of Rational Functions     When a drug is injected into a patient, the drug's concentration in the patient's bloodstream can be modeled by the function , with formula where gives the drug's concentration, in milligrams per liter, hours since the injection. A new injection is needed when the concentration falls to milligrams per liter. Using graphing technology, we will graph and to examine the situation and answer some important questions.   Graph of           What is the concentration after 10 hours?    After how many hours since the first injection is the drug concentration greatest?    After how many hours since the first injection should the next injection be given?    What happens to the drug concentration if no further injections are given?          To determine the concentration after 10 hours, we will evaluate at . After hours, the concentration will be about  0.2777  .     Using the graph, we can see that the maximum concentration of the drug will be  0.53  and will occur after about hours.    The approximate points of intersection and tell us that the concentration of the drug will reach  0.35  after about hours and again after about hours. Given the rising, then falling shape of the graph, this means that another dose will need to be administered after about hours.    From the initial graph, it appears that the concentration of the drug will diminish to zero with enough time passing. Exploring further, we can see both numerically and graphically that for larger and larger values of , the function values get closer and closer to zero. This is shown in Figure and Figure .    Numerical Values for                                Graph of              In Section , we'll explore how to algebraically solve . For now, we will rely on technology to make the graph and determine intersection points.  The function , where , is a rational function , which is a type of function defined as follows.   Rational Function   A rational function  is a function in the form where and are polynomial functions, but is not the constant zero function. rational function        Identify which of the following are rational functions and which are not.   defined by   is   is not  a rational function.    defined by   is   is not  a rational function.    defined by   is   is not  a rational function.    defined by   is   is not  a rational function.    defined by   is   is not  a rational function.                                defined by is a rational function as its formula is a polynomial divided by another polynomial.    defined by is not a rational function because the numerator contains and is therefore not a polynomial.    defined by is a rational function as its formula is a polynomial divided by another polynomial.    defined by is not a rational function because the denominator contains the absolute value of an expression with variables in it.    defined by is not a rational function because the numerator contains which has a variable in the exponent.          A rational function's graph is not always smooth like the one shown in Example . It could have breaks, as we'll see now.    Build a table and sketch the graph of the function where . Find the function's domain and range.  Since makes the denominator , the function will be undefined for . We'll start by choosing various -values and plotting the associated points.    Initial Values of          Point                                    undefined                   Initial Points for        Note that extra points were chosen near in the Figure , but it's still not clear on the graph what happens really close to . It will be essential that we include at least one -value between and and also between and .  Further, we'll note that dividing one number by a number that is close to yields a large number. For example, . In fact, the smaller the number is that we divide by, the larger our result becomes. So when gets closer and closer to , then gets closer and closer to . And then takes very large values.  When we plot additional points closer and closer to , we get larger and larger results. To the left of , the results are negative, so the connected curve has an arrow pointing downward there. The opposite happens to the right of , and an arrow points upward. We'll also draw the vertical line as a dashed line to indicate that the graph never actually touches it.    Values of          Point                                                undefined                               Full Graph of        Note that in Figure , the line was also drawn as a dashed line. This is because the values of will get closer and closer to zero as the inputs become more and more positive (or negative).  We know that the domain of this function is as the function is undefined at . We can determine this algebraically, and it is also evident in the graph.     The line in Example is referred to as a vertical asymptote . vertical asymptote The line is referred to as a horizontal asymptote . horizontal asymptote We'll use this vocabulary when referencing such lines, but the classification of vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptotes is beyond the scope of this book.         Algebraically find the domain of . Use technology to sketch a graph of this function.    To find a rational function's domain, we set the denominator equal to and solve:  Since and will cause the denominator to be , they are excluded from the domain. The function's domain is . In interval notation, the domain is .  To begin creating this graph, we'll use technology to create a table of function values, making sure to include values near both and . We'll sketch an initial plot of these.    Numerical Values for                                               undefined     undefined                                Initial Set-Up to Graph        We can now begin to see what happens near and . These are referred to as vertical asymptotes and will be graphed as dashed vertical lines as they are features of the graph but do not include function values.  The last thing we need to consider is what happens for large positive values of and large negative values of . Choosing a few values, we find:    Values for Large Positive                            Values for Large Negative                            Thus for really large positive and for really large negative , we see that the function values get closer and closer to . This is referred to as the horizontal asymptote, and will be graphed as a dashed horizontal line on the graph.  Putting all of this together, we can sketch a graph of this function.    Asymptotes Added for Graphing        Full Graph of          Let's look at another example where a rational function is used to model real life data.     The monthly operation cost of Saqui's shoe company is approximately . The cost of producing each pair of shoes is . As a result, the cost of producing pairs of shoes is dollars, and the average cost of producing each pair of shoes can be modeled by .  Answer the following questions with technology.   What's the average cost of producing pairs of shoes? Of producing pairs? Of producing pairs? What's the pattern?    To make the average cost of producing each pair of shoes cheaper than , at least how many pairs of shoes must Saqui's company produce?    Assume that her company's shoes are very popular. What happens to the average cost of producing shoes if more and more people keep buying them?       We will graph the function with technology. After adjusting window settings, we have:   Graph of           To answer this question, we locate the points where values are , and . They are and . They imply:   If the company produces pairs of shoes, the average cost of producing one pair is .    If the company produces pairs of shoes, the average cost of producing one pair is .    If the company produces pairs of shoes, the average cost of producing one pair is .   We can see the more shoes her company produces, the lower the average cost.     To answer this question, we locate the point where its -value is . With technology, we graph both and , and locate their intersection.   Intersection of and       The intersection implies the average cost of producing one pair is if her company produces pairs of shoes.     To answer this question, we substitute with some large numbers, and use technology to create a table of values:   Values for Large Positive                           We can estimate that the average cost of producing one pair is getting closer and closer to as her company produces more and more pairs of shoes.  Note that the cost of producing each pair is . This implies, for big companies whose products are very popular, the cost of operations can be ignored when calculating the average cost of producing each unit of product.           What makes a function be a rational function?      Describe what an asymptote is.      If there is a rational function with a vertical asymptote at , what does that mean about the denominator of the rational function?

In a forest, the number of deer can be modeled by the function where stands for the number of years from now. Answer the question with technology.  As time goes on, the population levels off at approximately deer living in the forest.        With technology, we can find -values of a few points when -values are very large. For example:               We can see the number of deer living in the forest is approaching           The concentration of a drug in a patient s blood stream, in milligrams per liter, can be modeled by the function where is the number of hours since the drug is injected. Answer the following question with technology.  The drug s concentration after 5 hours is milligrams per liter.        Use technology to graph the function    Locate the point whose -value is which is This point implies the drug s concentration will be approximately milligrams per liter hours since injection.           The concentration of a drug in a patient s blood stream, in milligrams per liter, can be modeled by the function m>, with where is the number of hours since the drug is injected. Use technology to complete the following sentence.  The drug s concentration is 1.64 milligrams per liter hours after injection and then again hours after injection.             To locate the points on where the -value is we use technology to graph the function and and then locate their intersections.    The intersections are and Those points imply the drug concentration in the blood stream will be approximately milligrams per liter approximately hours since injection, and then again at this level hours since the injection.           The concentration of a drug in a patient s blood stream, in milligrams per liter, can be modeled by the function where is the number of hours since the drug is injected. Answer the following question with technology.  hours since injection, the drug s concentration is at the maximum value of milligrams per liter.             To locate the points on where the -value is maximum, we use technology to graph the function and then locate its maximum value.    The point with the maximum -value is It implies the drug concentration in the blood stream will reach the maximum value of milligrams per liter approximately hours since injection.           The concentration of a drug in a patient s blood stream, in milligrams per liter, can be modeled by the function where is the number of hours since the drug is injected. Answer the following question with technology.  As time goes on, the drug s concentration in the patient s blood stream levels off at approximately milligrams per liter.        With technology, we can find -values of a few points when -values are very large. For example:            We can see the concentration is approaching This makes sense since the drug will eventually disappear from the patient s body.          "

A new injection is needed when the concentration falls to milligrams per liter. Using graphing technology, we will graph and to examine the situation and answer some important questions.   Graph of           What is the concentration after 10 hours?    After how many hours since the first injection is the drug concentration greatest?    After how many hours since the first injection should the next injection be given?    What happens to the drug concentration if no further injections are given?          To determine the concentration after 10 hours, we will evaluate at . After hours, the concentration will be about  0.2777  .     Using the graph, we can see that the maximum concentration of the drug will be  0.53  and will occur after about hours.    The approximate points of intersection and tell us that the concentration of the drug will reach  0.35  after about hours and again after about hours. Given the rising, then falling shape of the graph, this means that another dose will need to be administered after about hours.    From the initial graph, it appears that the concentration of the drug will diminish to zero with enough time passing. Exploring further, we can see both numerically and graphically that for larger and larger values of , the function values get closer and closer to zero. This is shown in Figure and Figure .

  "body": " Multiplication and Division of Rational Expressions   In the last section, we learned some rational function applications. In this section, we will learn how to simplify rational expressions, and how to multiply and divide them.   Alternative Video Lesson      Simplifying Rational Expressions  Consider the two rational functions below. At first glance, which function looks simpler?          It can be argued that the function is simpler, at least with regard to the ease with which we can determine its domain, quickly evaluate it, and also determine where its function value is zero. All of these things are considerably more difficult with the function .  These two functions are actually the same function. Using factoring and the same process of canceling that's used with numerical ratios, we will learn how to simplify the function into the function . (The full process for simplifying will be shown in Example .)  To see a simple example of the process for simplifying a rational function or expression, let's look at simplifying and by canceling common factors:   The statement for was added when the factors of were canceled. This is because was undefined for , so the simplified version must also be undefined for .   Cancel Factors, not Terms  It may be tempting to want to try to simplify into by canceling each that appears. But these 's are terms (pieces that are added with other pieces), not factors . Canceling (an act of division) is only possible with factors (an act of multiplication).   The process of canceling factors is key to simplifying rational expressions. If the expression is not given in factored form, then this will be our first step. We'll now look at a few more examples.     Simplify the rational function formula and state the domain of .     To start, we'll factor the numerator and denominator. We'll then cancel any factors common to both the numerator and denominator.      The domain of this function will incorporate the explicit domain restriction that was stated when the factor of was canceled from both the numerator and denominator. We will also exclude from the domain as this value would make the denominator zero. Thus the domain of is .     When simplifying the function in Example , we cannot simply write . The reason is that this would result in our simplified version of the function having a different domain than the original . More specifically, for our original function it held that was undefined, and this still needs to be true for the simplified form of .      Simplify the rational function formula and state the domain of .        The domain of this function will incorporate the explicit restrictions that were stated when the factors of and were canceled from both the numerator and denominator. Since the factor is still in the denominator, we also need the restriction that . Therefore the domain of is .       Simplify the expression .     To start, we need to recognize that is not written in standard form (where terms are written from highest degree to lowest degree). Before attempting to factor this expression, we'll re-write it as .           Simplify the expression .    To begin simplifying this expression, we will rewrite each polynomial in descending order. Then we'll factor out the GCF, including the constant from both the numerator and denominator because their leading terms are negative.          Simplify the rational function formula and state the domain of .     To simplify this rational function, we'll first note that both the numerator and denominator have four terms. To factor them we'll need to use factoring by grouping. (Note that if this technique didn't work, very few other approaches would be possible.) Once we've used factoring by grouping, we'll cancel any factors common to both the numerator and denominator and state the associated restrictions.      In determining the domain of this function, we'll need to account for any implicit and explicit restrictions. When the factor was canceled, the explicit statement of was given. The denominator in the final simplified form of this function has . There is no value of for which , so the only restriction is that . Therefore the domain is .      Simplify the expression . In this example, there are two variables. It is still possible that in examples like this, there can be domain restrictions when simplifying rational expressions. However since we are not studying functions of more than one variable, this textbook ignores domain restrictions with examples like this one.                Multiplication of Rational Functions and Expressions  Recall the rule for multiplying fractions , which states that the product of two fractions is equal to the product of their numerators divided by the product of their denominators. We will use this same rule for multiplying rational expressions.   When multiplying fractions, one approach is to multiply the numerator and denominator, and then simplify the fraction that results by determining the greatest common factor in both the numerator and denominator, like this:      This approach works great when we can easily identify that is the greatest common factor in both and . But in more complicated instances, it isn't always an easy approach. It also won't work particularly well when we have instead of as a factor, as we'll see shortly.   Another approach to multiplying and simplifying fractions involves utilizing the prime factorization of each the numerator and denominator, like this:      The method for multiplying and simplifying rational expressions is nearly identical, as shown here:   This process will be used for both multiplying and dividing rational expressions. The main distinctions in various examples will be in the factoring methods required.    Multiply the rational expressions: .    Note that to factor the second rational expression, we'll want to re-write the terms in descending order for both the numerator and denominator. In the denominator, we'll first factor out as the leading term is .       Multiply the rational expressions: . Note this book ignores domain restrictions on multivariable expressions.    We won't need to factor anything in this example, and can simply multiply across and then simplify.        Division of Rational Functions and Expressions  We can divide rational expressions using the rule for dividing fractions , which simply requires that we change dividing by an expression to multiplying by its reciprocal. Let's look at a few examples.     Divide the rational expressions: .          In the first step of , the restriction was used. We hadn't canceled anything yet, so why is there this restriction already? It's because the original expression had in a denominator, which means that is not a valid input. In the first step of simplifying, the denominator went to the numerator and we lost the information that was not a valid input, so we stated it explicitly. Always be sure to compare the restrictions of the original expression with each step throughout the process.     Simplify the rational expression using division: .    To begin, we'll note that the larger fraction bar is denoting division, so we will use multiplication by the reciprocal. After that, we'll factor each expression and cancel any common factors.       Divide the rational expressions: .           Divide the rational expressions: .     Note here that we didn't have to include a restriction in the very first step. That restriction would have been , but since  still cannot be inputted into any of the subsequent expressions, we don't need to explicitly state as a restriction because the expressions tell us that implicitly already.      Divide the rational expressions: . Note this book ignores domain restrictions on multivariable expressions.            Divide the rational expressions: .

  "body": " Addition and Subtraction of Rational Expressions   In the last section, we learned how to multiply and divide rational expressions. In this section, we will learn how to add and subtract rational expressions.   Alternative Video Lesson      Introduction   Julia is taking her family on a boat trip miles down the river and back. The river flows at a speed of miles per hour and she wants to drive the boat at a constant speed, miles per hour downstream and back upstream. Due to the current of the river, the actual speed of travel is miles per hour going downstream, and miles per hour going upstream. If Julia plans to spend hours for the whole trip, how fast should she drive the boat?  We need to review three forms of the formula for movement at a constant rate: where stands for distance, represents speed, and stands for time. According to the third form, the time it takes the boat to travel downstream is , and the time it takes to get back upstream is .   The function to model the time of the whole trip is where stands for time in hours, and is the boat's speed in miles per hour. Let's look at the graph of this function in Figure . Note that since the speed and the time should be positive in context, it's only the first quadrant of Figure that matters.   Graph of and   a Cartesian grid of the rational function which has 3 separate segments;a curve in the lower left quadrant;a middle curve that goes through the origin;a curve on the right that goes through the point (4,8)      To find the speed that Julia should drive the boat to make the round trip last hours we can use graphing technology to solve the equation graphically and we see that . This tells us that a speed of miles per hour will give a total time of hours to complete the trip. To go downstream it would take hours; and to go upstream it would take hours.   The point of this section is to work with expressions like , where two rational expressions are added (or subtracted). There are times when it is useful to combine them into a single fraction. We will learn that the expression is equal to the expression , and we will learn how to make that simplification.      Addition and Subtraction of Rational Expressions with the Same Denominator  The process of adding and subtracting rational expressions will be very similar to the process of adding and subtracting purely numerical fractions.  If the two expressions have the same denominator, then we can rely on the property of adding and subtracting fractions and simplify that result.   Let's review how to add fractions with the same denominator:   We can add and subtract rational expressions in the same way:     Steps to Adding\/Subtracting Rational Expressions    Identify the LCD  Determine the least common denominator of all of the denominators.    Build  If necessary, build up each expression so that the denominators are the same.    Add\/Subtract  Combine the numerators using the properties of adding and subtracting fractions .    Simplify  Simplify the resulting rational expression as much as possible. This may require factoring the numerator.       Add the rational expressions: .    These expressions already have a common denominator: Note that we didn't stop at . If possible, we must simplify the numerator and denominator. Since this is a multivariable expression, this textbook ignores domain restrictions while canceling.      Addition and Subtraction of Rational Expressions with Different Denominators   To add rational expressions with different denominators, we'll need to build each fraction to the least common denominator, in the same way we do with numerical fractions. Let's briefly review this process by adding and :      This exact method can be used when adding rational expressions containing variables. The key is that the expressions must have the same denominator before they can be added or subtracted. If they don't have this initially, then we'll identify the least common denominator and build each expression so that it has that denominator.  Let's apply this to adding the two expressions with denominators that are and from Example .    Add the rational expressions and fully simplify the function given by .           Add the rational expressions:     The least common denominator of and must include two 's and two 's, as well as . Thus it is . We will build both denominators to before doing addition.       Let's look at a few more complicated examples.    Subtract the rational expressions:     To start, we'll make sure each denominator is factored. Then we'll find the least common denominator and build each expression to that denominator. Then we will be able to combine the numerators and simplify the expression. Note that we must factor the numerator in and try to reduce the fraction (which we did).     In Example , be careful to subtract the entire numerator of . When this expression is in the numerator of , it's implicitly grouped and doesn't need parentheses. But once is subtracted from , we need to add parentheses so the entire expression is subtracted.   In the next example, we'll look at adding a rational expression to a polynomial. Much like adding a fraction and an integer, we'll rely on writing that expression as itself over one in order to build its denominator.    Add the expressions:      Note that we factored the numerator to reduce the fraction if possible. Even though it was not possible in this case, leaving it in factored form makes it easier to see that it is reduced.      Subtract the expressions:     To start, we'll need to factor each of the denominators. After that, we'll identify the LCD and build each denominator accordingly. Then we can combine the numerators and simplify the resulting expression.           Describe how to add two rational expressions when they have the same denominator.      Suppose you are adding two rational expressions where one of them has a quadratic denominator, and the other has a linear denominator. What is the first thing you should try to do with respect to the quadratic denominator?        Review and Warmup     Add:        To add two fractions with the same denominator, we simply add up the numerators and keep the denominator unchanged.  The result is:            Add:        To add two fractions with the same denominator, we simply add up the numerators and keep the denominator unchanged.  The result is:            Add:        To add two fractions with different denominators, we first have to find a common denominator.  In this case, the least common multiple of and is .  Look at the first fraction . To change the denominator to , we multiply at both the top and bottom, and we have:   Similarly, we change the second fraction s denominator to :   Now we can add those two fractions. The full process is:            Add:        To add two fractions with different denominators, we first have to find a common denominator.  In this case, the least common multiple of and is .

To change the denominator to , we multiply at both the top and bottom, and we have:   The second fraction already has the common denominator.  Finally, we can do the subtraction. The whole process is:   The answer is .           Subtract:        To subtract two fractions with different denominators, we first have to find a common denominator.

The river flows at a speed of miles per hour and she wants to drive the boat at a constant speed, miles per hour downstream and back upstream. Due to the current of the river, the actual speed of travel is miles per hour going downstream, and miles per hour going upstream. If Julia plans to spend hours for the whole trip, how fast should she drive the boat?  We need to review three forms of the formula for movement at a constant rate: where stands for distance, represents speed, and stands for time. According to the third form, the time it takes the boat to travel downstream is , and the time it takes to get back upstream is .   The function to model the time of the whole trip is where stands for time in hours, and is the boat's speed in miles per hour. Let's look at the graph of this function in Figure .

  "body": " Complex Fractions   In this section, we will learn how to simplify complex fractions, which have fractions in the numerator and\/or denominator of another fraction.   Alternative Video Lesson      Simplifying Complex Fractions  Consider the rational expression . It's difficult to quickly evaluate this expression, or determine the important information such as its domain. This type of rational expression, which contains a fraction within a fraction, is referred to as a complex fraction . complex fraction Our goal is to simplify such a fraction so that it has a single numerator and a single denominator, neither of which contain any fractions themselves.   A complex fraction may have fractions in its numerator and\/or denominator. Here is an example to show how we use division to simplify a complex fraction.       What if the expression had something more complicated in the denominator, like ? We would no longer be able to simply multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator, since we don't immediately know the reciprocal of that denominator. Instead, we could multiply the main numerator and denominator by something that eliminates all of the internal denominators. (We'll use the LCD to determine this). For example, with , we can multiply by :    In the last example, it's important to identify which fraction bar is the main fraction bar, and which fractions are internal. Comparing the two expressions below, both of which are one over two over three , we see that they are not equivalent. For the first of these, the main fraction bar is above the , but for the second of these, the main fraction bar is above the .   To attack multiple fractions in a complex fraction, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD of all the internal fractions, as we will show in the next example.    Simplify the complex fraction .     The internal denominators are , , and , so the LCD is . We will thus multiply the main numerator and denominator by and simplify the result:        Next we will evaluate a function whose formula is a complex fraction and then simplify the result.    Find each function value for .                          We will determine each function value by replacing with the specified number and then simplify the complex fraction:             When evaluating at , we can quickly see that this results in division by zero: Thus is undefined.       Therefore is undefined.       We have simplified complex fractions involving numbers and now we will apply the same concept to complex fractions with variables.    Simplify the complex fraction .     To start, we look at the internal denominators and identify the LCD as . We'll multiply the main numerator and denominator by the LCD, and then simplify. Since we are multiplying by , it is important to note that cannot be , since is undefined.          Simplify the complex fraction .     The internal denominators are both , so this is the LCD and we will multiply the main numerator and denominator by this expression. Since we are multiplying by , what -value would cause to equal ? Solving leads to . So cannot be , since is undefined.            Completely simplify the function defined by . Then determine the domain of this function.    The LCD of the internal denominators is . We will thus multiply the main numerator and denominator by the expression and then simplify the resulting expression. In the original (unsimplified) function, we could see that and . In the simplified function, we need , so we can also see that . Therefore the domain of the function is .      Simplify the complex fraction .    The only internal denominator is , so we will begin by multiplying the main numerator and denominator by this. Then we'll simplify the resulting expression.       Simplify the complex fraction . Recall that with a multivariable expression, this textbook ignores domain restrictions.     We multiply the numerator and denominator by the common denominator of and , which is :          Simplify the complex fraction .    First, we check all quadratic polynomials to see if they can be factored and factor them: Next, we identify the common denominator of the three fractions, which is . We then multiply the main numerator and denominator by that expression: Note that since both the numerator and denominator are prime trinomials, this expression can neither factor nor simplify any further.        What does it mean for a fraction to be a complex fraction?      When simplifying a complex fraction, why is it necessary to keep track of domain restrictions?

  "body": " Solving Rational Equations    Alternative Video Lesson      Solving Rational Equations  solving rational equations  We open this section looking back on Example . Julia is taking her family on a boat trip miles down the river and back. The river flows at a speed of miles per hour and she wants to drive the boat at a constant speed, miles per hour downstream and back upstream. Due to the current of the river, the actual speed of travel is miles per hour going downstream, and miles per hour going upstream. If Julia plans to spend hours for the whole trip, how fast should she drive the boat?  The time it takes Julia to drive the boat downstream is hours, and upstream is hours. The function to model the whole trip's time is where stands for time in hours. The trip will take hours, so we want to equal , and we have: . Instead of using the function's graph, we will solve this equation algebraically. You may wish to review the technique of eliminating denominators discussed in Subsection . We can use the same technique with variable expressions in the denominators. To remove the fractions in this equation, we will multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator , and we have:     At this point, logically all that we know is that the only possible solutions are and . Because of the step where factors were canceled, it's possible that these might not actually be solutions to the original equation. They each might be what is called an extraneous solution . extraneous solution An extraneous solution is a number that would appear to be a solution based on the solving process, but actually does not make the original equation true. Because of this, it is important that these proposed solutions be checked. Note that we're not checking to see if we made a calculation error, but are instead checking to see if the proposed solutions actually solve the original equation.   We check these values. Algebraically, both values do check out to be solutions. In the context of this scenario, the boat's speed can't be negative, so we only take the solution . If Julia drives at miles per hour, the whole trip would take hours. This result matches the solution in Example .   Rational Equation  rational equation  equation rational   A rational equation is an equation involving one or more rational expressions . Usually, we consider these to be equations that have the variable in the denominator of at least one term.    Let's look at another application problem.    It takes Ku hours to paint a room and it takes Jacob hours to paint the same room. If they work together, how long would it take them to paint the room?    Since it takes Ku hours to paint the room, he paints of the room each hour. Similarly, Jacob paints of the room each hour. If they work together, they paint of the room each hour.  Assume it takes hours to paint the room if Ku and Jacob work together. This implies they paint of the room together each hour. Now we can write this equation: . To clear away denominators, we multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator of , and , which is : Does the possible solution check as an actual solution? It does, so it is a solution. If Ku and Jacob work together, it would take them hours to paint the room.    We are ready to outline a general process for solving a rational equation.   Solving Rational Equations  solving rational equations   To solve a rational equation,   Find the least common denominator for all terms in the equation.    Multiply every term in the equation by the least common denominator    Every denominator should cancel leaving a simpler kind of equation to solve. Use previous method to solve that equation.       Let's look at a few more examples of solving rational equations.    Solve for in .    The common denominator is . We will multiply both sides of the equation by : Does the possible solution check as an actual solution? It checks, so is a solution. We write the solution set as .       Solve for in .    The common denominator is . We will multiply both sides of the equation by :  Do the possible solutions and check as actual solutions? The possible solution does not actually work, since it leads to division by in the equation. It is an extraneous solution. However, is a valid solution. The only solution to the equation is , and thus we can write the solution set as .      Solve for in .    To find the common denominator, we need to factor all denominators if possible: Now we can see the common denominator is . We will multiply both sides of the equation by : Does the possible solution check as an actual solution? The possible solution does not actually work, since it leads to division by in the equation. So this is an extraneous solution, and the equation actually has no solution. We could say that its solution set is the empty set, .      Solve , where gives a drug's concentration in milligrams per liter hours since an injection. (This function was explored in the introduction of Section .)    To solve , we'll begin by setting up . We'll begin by identifying that the LCD is , and multiply each side of the equation by this: This results in a quadratic equation so we will put it in standard form and use the quadratic formula: Each of these answers should be checked in the original equation; they both work. In context, this means that the drug concentration will reach milligrams per liter about hours after the injection was given, and again hours after the injection was given.        Solving Rational Equations for a Specific Variable  Rational equations can contain many variables and constants and we can solve for any one of them. The process for solving still involves multiplying each side of the equation by the LCD. Instead of having a numerical answer though, our final result will contain other variables and constants.     In physics, when two resistances, and , are connected in a parallel circuit, the combined resistance, , can be calculated by the formula . Solve for in this formula.    The common denominator is . We will multiply both sides of the equation by :       Here is the slope formula . Solve for in this formula.    The common denominator is . We will multiply both sides of the equation by :       Solve the rational equation for .    Our first step will be to multiply each side by the LCD, which is simply . After that, we'll isolate all terms containing , factor out , and then finish solving for that variable.       Solving Rational Equations Using Technology  In some instances, it may be difficult to solve rational equations algebraically. We can instead use graphing technology to obtain approximate solutions. Let's look at one such example.    Solve the equation using graphing technology.     We will define and , and then look for the points of intersection.    Graph of and        Since the two functions intersect at approximately and , the solutions to are approximately and . We can write the solution set as or in several other forms. It may be important to do something to communicate that these solutions are approximations. Here we used , but you could also just say in words that the solutions are approximate.         Describe what an extraneous solution to a rational equation is.      In general, when solving a rational equation, multiplying through by the will leave you with a simpler equation to solve.      When you believe you have the solutions to a rational equation, what is more important than usual (compared to other kinds of equations) for you to do?

We should examine one more angle to our soccer kick question. The formula finds the height of the soccer ball in feet above the ground at a time seconds after being kicked.  Using technology, find out what the maximum height of the ball was and when it reached that height.  Using technology, solve for when and interpret the meaning of this in a complete sentence.  Using technology, solve for when and interpret the meaning of this in a complete sentence.       Since each of these questions revolves around using technology to find the answers, we should begin this question by making a graph of the scenario. First, keep in mind that the height cannot be a negative number in this example, so any part of the curve below the -axis has been omitted.   A Soccer Kick on Mars Part II           To find the maximum height of the ball, we need to find the highest point on the graph. Using technology, that point is about . So, the maximum occurred about 2.23 after being kicked and it reached a maximum height of 30.25 above the ground.   A Soccer Kick on Mars Part II Maximum          To solve for when , we need to look for any points on the graph where the -value is . Using technology to graph the function, we can see that the the curve has a -value of when and . This means that at both 0.93 and 3.53 after being kicked and the soccer ball was at a height of 20 .   A Soccer Kick on Mars Part II at 20          To solve for when , we need to look for any points on the graph where the -value is . Using technology to graph the function, we can see that the the curve has a -value of when and . This means that at both 0 and 4.47 after being kicked and the soccer ball was at a height of 0 . More importantly, these two times are indicating the times that the ball is on the ground just before being kicked and just as it lands.

The boat traveled from Town A to Town B at the speed of miles per hour.  The boat traveled from Town B back to Town A at the speed of miles per hour.           A river flows at miles per hour. A boat traveled with the current from Town A to Town B, which are miles apart. Then, the boat turned around, and traveled against the current to reach Town C, which is miles away from Town B. The second leg of the trip (Town B to Town C) took the same time as the first leg (Town A to Town B). During this whole trip, the boat was driving at a constant still-water speed. Answer the following question:  During this trip, the boat s speed on still water was miles per hour.        Assume that the boat s still-water speed was miles per hour.  Since the current s speed was miles per hour, the boat traveled from Town A to Town B (with the current) at miles per hour, and from Town B to Town C (against the current) at miles per hour.  Using the formula , we know the boat traveled from Town A to Town B in hours; and it traveled from Town B to Town C in hours.  It s given that those two legs took the same amount of time, so we can write an equation and solve it:   The boat s still-water speed was miles per hour.           A river flows at miles per hour. A boat traveled with the current from Town A to Town B, which are miles apart. The boat stayed overnight at Town B.

Since it takes Ku hours to paint the room, he paints of the room each hour. Similarly, Jacob paints of the room each hour. If they work together, they paint of the room each hour.  Assume it takes hours to paint the room if Ku and Jacob work together. This implies they paint of the room together each hour. Now we can write this equation: . To clear away denominators, we multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator of , and , which is : Does the possible solution check as an actual solution? It does, so it is a solution. If Ku and Jacob work together, it would take them hours to paint the room.   "

  "body": " Introduction to Exponent Rules   In this section, we look at some properties of exponents that we can use when simplifying expressions that have multiplication and exponents.   Alternative Video Lesson      Exponent Basics  Before we discuss any exponent rules, let's remind ourselves about exponent fundamentals. When working with expressions with exponents, we have the following vocabulary: For example, when we calculate , the base is , the exponent base  exponent is , and the expression is called the 2nd base  power of . exponent  exponent power  power   Exponents indicate repeated multiplication. When the exponent is a positive integer, the power can be rewritten as repeated multiplication of the base. For example, the th power of can be written as factors of like so:     Exponent Rules   Product Rule  If we write out without using exponents, we'd have: If we then count how many s are being multiplied together, we find we have , a total of seven s. So simplifies like this:      Simplify .  To simplify , we write this out in its expanded form, as a product of 's, we have Note that we obtained the exponent of by adding and .    This demonstrates our first exponent rule, the Product Rule : when multiplying two exponent product rule expressions that have the same base, we can simplify the product by adding the exponents.      Use the properties of exponents to simplify the expression.         We add the exponents as follows:        Recall that . It helps to remember this when multiplying certain expressions together.    Multiply by using the distributive property.  According to the distributive property, How can we simplify that term ? It's really the same as , so according to the Product Rule, it is . So we have:      Power to a Power Rule  If we write out without using exponents, we'd have multiplied by itself: If we again count how many s are being multiplied, we have a total of two groups each with five s. So we'd have instances of a . So simplifies like this:      Simplify .  To simplify , we write this out in its expanded form, as a product of 's, we have Note that we obtained the exponent of by multiplying and .    This demonstrates our second exponent rule, the Power to a Power Rule : when a exponent power to a power rule base is raised to an exponent and that expression is raised to another exponent, we multiply the exponents.      Use the properties of exponents to simplify the expression.         We multiply the exponents as follows:         Product to a Power Rule  The third exponent rule deals with having multiplication inside a set of parentheses and an exponent outside the parentheses. If we write out without using an exponent, we'd have multiplied by itself five times: Keeping in mind that there is multiplication between every and , and multiplication between all of the parentheses pairs, we can reorder and regroup the factors: We could leave it written this way if feels especially large. But if you are able to evaluate , then perhaps a better final version of this expression is .  We essentially applied the outer exponent to each factor inside the parentheses. It is important to see how the exponent applied to both the  and the , not just to the .     Simplify .  To simplify , we write this out in its expanded form, as a product of 's and 's, we have Note that the exponent on can simply be applied to both and .    This demonstrates our third exponent rule, the Product to a Power Rule : when a exponent product to a power rule product is raised to an exponent, we can apply the exponent to each factor in the product.      Use the properties of exponents to simplify the expression.         We multiply the exponents and apply the rule as follows:         Summary of the Rules of Exponents for Multiplication  exponent introductory rules   If and are real numbers, and and are positive integers, then we have the following rules:     Product Rule       Power to a Power Rule       Product to a Power Rule        Many examples will make use of more than one exponent rule. In deciding which exponent rule to work with first, it's important to remember that the order of operations still applies.    Simplify the following expressions.                   Since we cannot simplify anything inside the parentheses, we'll begin simplifying this expression using the . We'll apply the outer exponent of 4 to each factor inside the parentheses. Then we'll use the to finish the simplification process. Note that is too large to actually compute, even with a calculator, so we leave it written as .    According to the order of operations, we should first simplify any exponents before carrying out any multiplication. Therefore, we'll begin simplifying this by applying the and then finish using the .         We cannot simplify an expression like using the , as the factors and do not have the same base.       How many exponent rules are discussed in this section? Write an example of each rule in action.      The order of operations say that operations inside parentheses should get the highest priority. But with , you cannot actually do anything with the and the . Which exponent rule allows you to sidestep the order of operations and still simplify this expression a little?       Review and Warmup    Evaluate each power expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Skills Practice    Use the properties of exponents to simplify the expression.                                                                         We have two powers with the same base. So we can keep that base, and add the exponents:                  We have two powers with the same base. So we can keep that base, and add the exponents:                                                                              This expression raises to an exponent, and then raises the result to another exponent. In this situation we can multiply the two exponents and get:                  This expression raises to an exponent, and then raises the result to another exponent. In this situation we can multiply the two exponents and get:                                                                              This expression is a product of two things ( and ) that is then raised to a power.

  "body": " More Exponent Rules   There are a few more properties for working with exponents that we have not yet covered.   Alternative Video Lesson      Review of Exponent Rules for Products and Exponents  In , we introduced three important properties of products with exponents. We begin this section with a recap of these exponent rules.   Summary of Exponent Rules (Thus Far)    Product Rule  When multiplying two expressions that have the same base, simplify the product by adding the exponents.     Power to a Power Rule  When a base is raised to an exponent and that expression is raised to another exponent, multiply the exponents.     Product to a Power Rule  When a product is raised to an exponent, apply the exponent to each factor in the product.     Quotient of Powers Rule  When dividing two expressions that have the same base, simplify the quotient by subtracting the exponents. We require that the base here not be zero. For now, we only know this rule when .          Simplify    Simplify    Simplify    Simplify                           We add the exponents because this is a product of powers with the same base:     We multiply the exponents because this is a power being raised to a power:     We apply the power to each factor in the product:     We subtract the exponents because this expression is dividing powers with the same base:             Quotient to a Power Rule  One property of exponent we have learned is the , as in . When two factors are multiplied and the product is raised to a power, we may apply the exponent to each of those factors individually. We can use the rules of fractions to extend this property to a quotient raised to a power.    Let be a real number, where . Find another way to write .    Writing the expression without an exponent and then simplifying, we have: Similar to the , we essentially applied the outer exponent to the factors inside the parentheses to factors of the numerator and factors of the denominator. The general pattern is:     Quotient to a Power Rule  exponent quotient to a power rule   For real numbers and (with ) and natural number ,     This property says that when you raise a fraction to a power, you may separately raise the numerator and denominator to that power. In , this means that we can directly calculate :        Simplify    Simplify If you end up with a large power of a specific number, leave it written that way.    Simplify If you end up with a large power of a specific number, leave it written that way.                      We can use the quotient to a power rule:     If we stick closely to the order of operations, we should first simplify inside the parentheses and then work with the outer exponent. Going this route, we will first use the quotient rule:   Now we can apply the outer exponent to each factor inside the parentheses using the product to a power rule.   To finish, we need to use the power to a power rule.     According to the order of operations, we should simplify inside parentheses first, then apply exponents, then divide. Since we cannot simplify inside the parentheses, we must apply the outer exponents to each factor inside the respective set of parentheses first:   At this point, we need to use the power-to-a-power rule:   To finish simplifying, we ll conclude with the quotient rule:             Zero as an Exponent  So far, we have been working with exponents that are natural numbers ( ). By the end of this section, we will expand our understanding to include exponents that are any integer, as with and . As a first step, let's explore how should behave as an exponent by considering the pattern of decreasing powers of in .   Descending Powers of          Power   Product   Result                  (divide by )         (divide by )         (divide by )             As we move down from one row to the row below it, we reduce the exponent in the power by and we remove a factor of from the product. The result in one row is half of the result of the previous row. The question is, what happens when the exponent gets down to and you remove the last remaining factor of ? Following that pattern with the final results, moving from to should mean the result of is divided by , leaving . So we have:      Zero as an Exponent  exponent zero   For any real number , we define to mean . That is,     It is worth noting that this is the definition for what it means to use as an exponent. Before this, we only had an official meaning for using natural numbers ( ) as exponents.   Zero to the Zero  Some conventions prefer to exclude from this definition. Whether or not you do that is not important for the purposes of this textbook.       Simplify the following expressions. Assume all variables represent nonzero real numbers.                                    To simplify any of these expressions, it is critical that we remember an exponent only applies to what it is touching or immediately next to.   In the expression the exponent applies to everything inside the parentheses.     In the expression the exponent applies to everything inside the parentheses,     In contrast to the previous example, the exponent only applies to the The exponent has a higher priority than negation in the order of operations. We should consider that and so:     In the expression the exponent only applies to the             Negative Exponents  We understand what it means for a variable to have a natural number exponent. For example, means . Now we will try to give meaning to an exponent that is a negative integer, like in .   To consider what it could possibly mean to have a negative integer exponent, let's extend the pattern we saw in . In that table, each time we move down a row, we reduce the power by and we divide the value by . We can continue this pattern in the power and value columns, going all the way down into when the exponent is negative.   Negative Powers of       Power  Result           (divide by )      (divide by )      (divide by )      (divide by )      (divide by )      (divide by )       We see a pattern where is equal to . Note that the choice of base was arbitrary, and this pattern works for all bases except , since we cannot divide by in moving from one row to the next.   Negative Integers as Exponents  exponent negative integer   For any nonzero real number and any natural number , we define to mean the reciprocal of . That is,     As with , we note that this is a definition . Prior to this point in this textbook, we only had an official meaning for when an exponent was or a positive integer.  Taking reciprocals of both sides leads to: . Taken together, these things tell us that when you have an expression and there is a negative exponent in the numerator, that power belongs in the denominator (with a positive exponent). And similarly, when you have an expression and there is a negative exponent in the denominator, that power belongs in the numerator (with a positive exponent). In other words, you can view a negative exponent as telling you to move something to\/from the numerator\/denominator of an expression, changing the sign of the exponent at the same time.  You may be expected to simplify expressions so that they do not have any negative exponents. This can always be accomplished using the above understanding. Try it with these exercises.       Write without using negative exponents.    Write without using negative exponents.    Simplify and write it without using negative exponents.                      An exponent only applies to whatever it is touching . In the expression only the is affected by the exponent.     Negative exponents tell us to move some variables between the numerator and denominator to make the exponents positive. The in the numerator should become in the denominator. The in the denominator should become in the numerator.   Notice that the factors of and did not move, as both of those factors had positive exponents.    The product of powers rule still applies, and we can add exponents even when one or both are negative:               Summary of Exponent Rules  Now that we have some new exponent rules beyond those from , let's summarize.   Summary of the Rules of Exponents for Multiplication and Division   If and are real numbers, and and are integers, then we have the following rules:     Product Rule       Power to a Power Rule       Product to a Power Rule       Quotient Rule   , as long as     Quotient to a Power Rule   , as long as     Zero Exponent Definition       Negative Exponent Definition       Negative Exponent Reciprocal Rule         Why we have and for some rules  We have to be careful to make sure the rules we state don't suggest that it would ever be OK to divide by zero. Dividing by zero leads us to expressions that have no meaning. For example, both and are undefined , meaning no one has defined what it means to divide a number by .    A Common Mistake  It may be tempting to apply the rules of exponents to expressions containing addition or subtraction. However, none of the involve addition or subtraction in the initial expression. Because whole number exponents mean repeated multiplication, not repeated addition or subtraction, trying to apply exponent rules in situations that do not use multiplication simply doesn't work.  Can we say something like ? How would that work out when , , and ? As we can see, that's not even close. This attempt at a sum rule falls apart. In fact, without knowing values for , , and , there's no way to simplify the expression .      Decide whether each statement is true or false.                                                                                                 False, Following the order of operations, on the left would simplify as which is However, on the right side, we have   Since the equation is false.    True. As the cube applies to the product of and     True. The coefficients do get multiplied together and the exponents added when the expressions are multiplied, so    False, When we have a power to a power, we multiply the exponents rather than adding them. So     False, The exponent of applies to and but does not apply to the So     False, The two terms on the left hand side are not like terms and there is no way to combine them.    True. The terms and are like terms, so    False, When and are multiplied, their coefficients are each So the coefficient of their product is still and we have    False, Note that neither the bases nor the exponents are the same. Following the order of operations, on the left would simplify as which is However, on the right side, we have Since the equation is false.    False, The exponent of on the number does not result in a negative number. Instead, which is          As we mentioned before, many situations we'll come across will require us to use more than one exponent rule. In these situations, we'll have to decide which rule to use first. There are often different, correct approaches we could take. But if we rely on order of operations , we will have a straightforward approach to simplify the expression correctly. To bring it all together, try these exercises.      Simplify and write it without using negative exponents.        In the expression the coefficients reduce using the properties of fractions. One way to simplify the variable powers is:      Simplify and write it without using negative exponents.        In the expression the exponent applies to each factor inside the parentheses.      Simplify and write it without using negative exponents.        To follow the order of operations in the expression the numerator inside the parentheses should be dealt with first. After that, we ll simplify the quotient inside the parentheses. As a final step, we ll apply the exponent to that simplified expression:      Simplify and write it without using negative exponents. Leave larger numbers (such as ) in exponent form.   We ll again rely on the order of operations, and look to simplify anything inside parentheses first and then apply exponents. In this example, we will begin by applying the product to a power rule, followed by the power to a power rule.              When you are considering using the exponent rule , are and allowed to be negative integers?      What are the differences between these three expressions?       If you rearrange so that it is written without negative exponents, how many factors will you have moved?        Review and Warmup    Evaluate each power expression.                                                                                                                                                                                          Skills Practice   Simplifying Expressions with Exponents   Use the properties of exponents to simplify the expression. If there are any exponents in your answer, they should be positive.             We add the exponents as follows:                  We add the exponents as follows:                  We multiply the exponents as follows:                  We multiply the exponents as follows:                  We multiply the exponents and apply the rule as follows                   We multiply the exponents and apply the rule as follows                   We multiply the coefficients, and add the exponents as follows:                  We multiply the coefficients, and add the exponents as follows:                  We multiply the coefficients, and add the exponents as follows                   We multiply the coefficients, and add the exponents as follows                   We multiply the exponents and apply the rule as follows                   We multiply the exponents and apply the rule as follows                   The zero-exponent rule says that where is any real number, so                   The zero-exponent rule says that where is any real number, so                   The zero-exponent definition says that where is any real number; notice that the exponent applies to , not to so                   The zero-exponent definition says that where is any real number; notice that the exponent applies to , not to so                   The zero-exponent rule says that where is any real number, so                   The zero-exponent rule says that where is any real number, so                   The zero-exponent rule says that where is any real number except , so                   The zero-exponent rule says that where is any real number except , so                   The zero-exponent rule says that where is any real number except ; note that the exponent is applied to both terms , so                   The zero-exponent rule says that where is any real number except ; note that the exponent is applied to both terms , so                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   The quotient to power rule says that   Also remember that   Using these two tools together allows us to write                   We evaluate the expression by remembering that is the same thing as for any non-zero, real value of                   We evaluate the expression by remembering that is the same thing as for any non-zero, real value of                   We evaluate the expression by remembering that is the same thing as for any non-zero, real value of .

Dividing by zero leads us to expressions that have no meaning. For example, both and are undefined , meaning no one has defined what it means to divide a number by .  "

  "title": "A Common Mistake.",
  "body": " A Common Mistake  It may be tempting to apply the rules of exponents to expressions containing addition or subtraction. However, none of the involve addition or subtraction in the initial expression. Because whole number exponents mean repeated multiplication, not repeated addition or subtraction, trying to apply exponent rules in situations that do not use multiplication simply doesn't work.  Can we say something like ? How would that work out when , , and ? As we can see, that's not even close. This attempt at a sum rule falls apart. In fact, without knowing values for , , and , there's no way to simplify the expression .  "

  "body": " Square and th Root Properties   In this section, we discuss what radical expressions like and mean, and learn some properties that allow these expressions to be simplified.   Alternative Video Lesson      Square Roots    Consider the non-negative number . You can ask the question what number multiplies by itself to make ? We use the symbol to represent the answer to this question, even if you know the answer is .  A way to visualize this question is with a square that has units of area inside it. What would a side length have to be? We use to represent that side length.        Square Root  Square root  Radical  Radical symbol  Symbol radical   Given a non-negative number , if for some positive number , then is called the square root of , and we can square root write instead of . The symbol is called the radical or the root . We call expressions with the radical  symbol radical expressions . The number inside the root radical is called the radicand . radicand     For example, if you see the expression , you should think about the equation (or if you prefer, the equation ) and ask yourself if you know a non-negative value for that solves that equation. Of course, is a non-negative solution. So we can say .  To demonstrate vocabulary, both and are radical expressions. In both expressions, the number is the radicand.   The word radical means something like on the fringes when used in politics, sports, and other places. It actually has that same meaning in math, when you consider a square with area as in .   Radical means off to the side.   A drawing of a square labeled with area A; the side lengths are labeled the square root of A      The one-digit multiplication times table has special numbers along the diagonal. They are known as perfect squares . And for working with square roots, it will be helpful perfect squares if you can memorize these first few perfect square numbers. For example, the times table tells us that . Just knowing that fact from memory lets us know that . It's advisable to memorize the following:                               Multiplication table with squares                                                                                                                                          Square Root Decimal Values  Most square roots have decimal expressions that go on forever. Take as an example. The number is between two perfect squares, and . Therefore, as demonstrated in , . In other words, So has a decimal value somewhere between and .        With a calculator, we can see: Actually the decimal will not terminate, and we can write with the symbol instead of an equal sign. To get we rounded down slightly from the true value of . With a calculator, we can check that , a little less than , but close.  When the radicand is a perfect square, its square root is a rational number. If the radicand is not a perfect square, the square root is irrational. (It has a decimal that goes on forever without any repeating pattern.) We want to be able to estimate square roots without using a calculator.   To estimate without a calculator, we can find the nearest perfect squares that are whole numbers on either side of . Recall that the perfect squares are The perfect square that is just below is and the perfect square just above is .     This tells us that is between and , or between and . We can also say that is much closer to than because is closer to , so we think or would be a good estimate.  To check our estimates ( or ) we can square them and see if the result is close to . We find and , so our estimates are pretty good.      Estimate without a calculator.        The radicand, is between and so is between and or between and We notice that is in the middle between and but closer to We estimate to be about  We can check our estimate by calculating:   So is close to and is close to          Cube Root and Higher Order Roots    The concept of a square root extends to a cube root . What if we have a number in mind, like , and we would like to know what number could be multiplied with itself three times to make ?  A way to visualize this question is to imagine a cube with units of volume inside it. What would an edge length have to be? We use to represent that edge length.        th Root  th root  Radical  Radical symbol  Symbol radical   Given a number , if for some number (or if you prefer, ) then is called an th root  th root of .   When is odd, there is always exactly one real number th root for any , and we write to mean that one th root.    When is even and is positive, there are two real number th roots, one of which is positive and the other of which is negative. We write to mean the positive th root.    When is even and is negative, there aren't any real number th roots, and we say that is not a real number .    When is , then is the th root. On other words, .     The symbol is called the th radical  th radical or the th root . We call expressions with the th root  symbol radical expressions . The number inside radicand the radical is called the radicand . The index of a radical is index the number in .    As we noted earlier, when we have , we can say cube root instead of rd root . Also, when we have , we usually say square root instead of nd root and we usually just write without the .  Here are some examples of th roots:    , because .     , because .     , because .     As with square roots, in general an th root's decimal value is a decimal that goes on forever. For example, . For practical applications, we may want to use a calculator to find a decimal approximation to an th root. Some calculators will do this for you directly, and some will not.   Maybe your calculator has a button that looks like . Then you should be able to type something like 3 20 to get .    Maybe your calculator has a button that looks like . Then you should be able to type something like 3 20 to get .    Maybe your calculator allows you to type letters, parentheses, and commas, and you can type root(3,20) to get .    Maybe your calculator allows you to type letters, parentheses, and commas, but the syntax for an th root is reversed from the last example, and you can type root(20,3) to get .    If your calculator has none of the above options, then you should be able to type 20^(1\/3) as a way to get . This is technically using mathematics we will learn later in .   Try using your own calculator to calculate so that you can become familiar with whatever method it uses.    Since is can be used to fill in the blanks in the equation it means that is a solution to the equation .     A solution to is .     A pyramid has a square base, and its height is equal to one side length of the square at its base. In this situation, the volume of the pyramid, in , is given by , where is the pyramid's base side length in . Archimedes dropped the pyramid in a bathtub, and judging by how high the water level rose, the volume of the pyramid is 243 (a little more than 1 ). How tall is the pyramid?      The equation tells us that: We can multiply on both sides by and: So we are looking for a solution to the equation . This means that is . A calculator tells us that this equals . So the pyramid's height is inches.     Roots of Negative Numbers  Can we find the square root of a negative number, like ? How about its cube root, ?  As noted in , when the index of an th root is odd, there will always be a real number th root even when the radicand is negative. For example, is , because .  When the index of an th root is even, it is a problem to have a negative radicand. For example, to find , you would need to find a value so that . But whether is positive or negative, multiplying by itself will give a positive result. It could never be . So there is no way to have a real number square root of a negative number. And the same thing is true for any even index th root with a negative radicand, such as . An even-indexed root of a negative number is not a real number.   Imaginary Numbers  Mathematicians imagined a new type of number, neither positive nor negative, that would multiply by itself to make a negative result. But that is beyond the scope of this section.   If you are confronted with an expression like or (any square root or even-indexed root of a negative number), you can state that the expression is not real or that it is not defined (as a real number). Don't get carried away though. Expressions like and  are defined, because the index is odd.    Radical Properties and Exponent Properties  In and , we learned some algebra properties of exponents. A summary of these properties is in . There are some similar properties for radicals, presented here without explanation. (These properties are easier to explain once we are in .)   Properties of Radicals for Multiplication and Division   If and are positive real numbers, and is a positive integer, then we have the following properties:     Root of a Product Property       Root of a Quotient Property   as long as      Knowing these algebra properties helps to make complicated radical expressions look simpler.   Simplify . Anything we can do to make the radicand a smaller simpler number is helpful. Note that , so we can write This expression is considered simpler than because the radicand is so much smaller.      Simplify        As with the previous example, it will help if can be written as a product of a perfect square. In this case, divides and So   But we aren t done. Can can be written as a product of a perfect square? Yes, because So   This is as simple as we can make this expression.         Simplify . Anything we can do to make the radicand a smaller simpler number is helpful. With lessons learned from the previous examples, maybe there is a way to rewrite as the product of two numbers in a helpful way. Since we have a cube root, writing as a product of a perfect cube would be helpful. We can write , where is a perfect cube. This expression is considered simpler than because the radicand is so much smaller.      Simplify        As with the previous example, it will help if can be written as a product of a th power. In this case, divides and So   This is as simple as we can make this expression.        When a radical is applied to a fraction, the is useful.   Simplify . According to the , This is as simple as we can make this expression, unless you prefer to write it as .      Simplify each of the following.                                           Multiplying Square Root Expressions  We can use the and the to multiply and divide square root expressions. We want to simplify each radical first to keep the radicands as small as possible.    Multiply .    We will simplify each radical first, and then multiply them together. We do not want to multiply because we would end up with a larger number that is harder to factor. It is worth noting that this is considered as simple as we can make it, because the radicand of is so small.       Multiply        First multiply the non-radical factors together and the radical factors together. Then look for further simplifications.           Multiply .    First multiply the fractions together under the radical. Then look for further simplifications.       Adding and Subtracting Square Root Expressions  We learned the previously and applied this to multiplication of square roots, but we cannot apply this property to the operations of addition or subtraction. Here are two examples to demonstrate why not. We do not get the same result if we combine radical sums and differences in the same way we can combine radical products and quotiens.  To add and subtract radical expressions, we need to recognize that we can only add and subtract like terms. In this case, we will call them like radicals . Adding like radicals will work just like adding like terms. In the same way that combines two like terms, combines two like radicals.    Simplify .    First, simplify each radical. Simplifying is the best way to understand whether or not we even have two like radicals that could be combined.        Simplify        First we will simplify the radical term where is the radicand, and we may see that we then have like radicals.           Simplify .     We cannot simplify the expression further because and are not like radicals.      Simplify .    In this example, we should multiply the latter two square roots first (after simplifying them) and then see if we have like radicals.       Distributing with Square Roots  In , we learned how to multiply polynomials like and . All the methods we learned there apply when we multiply square root expressions. We will look at a few examples done with different methods.    Multiply .    We will use the distributive property to do this problem:       Multiply .    We will use the FOIL Method to expand the product. There is an opportunity to simplify some of the radicals after multiplying.       Expand .    We will use the FOIL method to expand this expression:       Multiply .    We can once again use the FOIL method to expand this expression. (But it is worth noting that this expression is in the special form and will simplify to .)          Is there a difference between and ? Explain.      Choose one of the radical properties from .

  "body": " Rationalizing the Denominator   A radical expression typically has several equivalent forms. For example, and are the same number. Mathematics has a preference for one of these forms over the other, and this section is about how to convert a given radical expression to that form.   Alternative Video Lesson      Rationalizing the Denominator  rationalizing the denominator  To simplify radical expressions, we have seen that it helps to make the radicand as small as possible. Another helpful principle is to not leave any irrational numbers, such as or , in the denominator of a fraction. In other words, we want the denominator to be rational. The process of dealing with such numbers in the denominator is called rationalizing the denominator .  Let's see how we can replace with an equivalent expression that has no radical expressions in its denominator. If we multiply a radical by itself, the result is the radicand, by . As an example: With , we may multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number and have an equivalent expression. If we multiply the numerator and denominator by , we have: And voilà, we have an expression with no radical in its denominator. We can use a calculator to verify that , and also . They are equal.    Rationalize the denominator of the expressions.                   To rationalize the denominator of , we multiply both the numerator and denominator by . Note that we reduced a fraction whose numerator and denominator were no longer inside the radical.    To rationalize the denominator of , we could multiply both the numerator and denominator by , and it would be effective; however, we should note that the in the denominator can be reduced first. Doing this will simplify the arithmetic because there will be smaller numbers to work with. Now all that remains is to multiply the numerator and denominator by .            Rationalize the denominator in        We will rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by   Again note that the fraction was simplified in the last step.          Rationalize the denominator in .    This example is slightly different. The entire fraction, including its denominator, is within a radical. Having a denominator within a radical is just as undesirable as having a radical in a denominator. So we want to do something to change the expression.             Rationalize the Denominator Using the Difference of Squares Formula  Conside the number . Its denominator is irrational, approximately . Can we rewrite this as an equivalent expression where the denominator is rational? Let's try multiplying the numerator and denominator by : We removed one radical from the denominator, but created another. We need to find another method. The difference of squares formula will help: Those two squares in can be used as a tool to annihilate radicals. Take , and multiply both the numerator and denominator by :     Rationalize the denominator in .    To address the radicals in the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by .        Rationalize the denominator in        To remove the radical in with the difference of squares formula, we multiply it with              To rationalize a denominator in an expression like , explain the first step you will take.      What is the special pattern that helps to rationalize the denominator in an expression like ?        Simplify the expression. If the result has a denominator, it must be rationalized.             We need to legally remove the radical from the denominator.

  "body": " Radical Expressions and Rational Exponents   Recall that in , we learned to evaluate the cube root of a number, say , we can type 8^(1\/3) into a calculator. This suggests that . In this section, we will learn why this is true, and how to simplify expressions with rational exponents.  Many learners will find a review of exponent properties to be helpful before continuing with the current section. covers an introduction to exponent properties, and there is more in . The basic properties are summarized in . These properties are still true and we can use them throughout this section whenever they might help.   Alternative Video Lesson      Radical Expressions and Rational Exponents  Compare the following calculations: If we rewrite the above calculations with exponents, we have: Since and are both positive, and squaring either of them generates the same number, we conclude that: We can verify this result by entering 9^(1\/2) into a calculator, and we get 3 . In general for any non-negative real number , we have:   Similarly, when is non-negative all of the following are true:   For example, when we see , that is equal to , which we know is because . How can we relate this to the exponential expression ? In a sense, we are cutting up into equal parts. But not parts that you add together, rather parts that you multiply together.  Let's summarize this information with a new exponent property.   Radicals and Rational Exponents Property  If is any natural number, and is any non-negative real number, then . Additionally, if is an odd natural number, then even when is negative, we still have .    Exponents on Negative Bases  Some computers and calculators follow different conventions when there is an exponent on a negative base. To see an example of this, visit WolframAlpha and try entering cuberoot(-8) , and then try (-8)^(1\/3) , and you will get different results. cuberoot(-8) will come out as , but (-8)^(1\/3) will come out as a certain non-real complex number. Most likely, any calculator you are using does behave as in , but you should confirm this.   With the , we can re-write radical expressions as expressions with rational exponents.    Write the radical expression as an expression with a rational exponent. Then use a calculator to find its decimal approximation.  According to the , . A calculator tells us that 6^(1\/3) works out to approximately .   For many examples that follow, we will not need a calculator. We will, however, need to recognize the roots in .   Small Roots of Appropriate Natural Numbers    Square Roots  Cube Roots  -Roots  -Roots  Roots of Powers of                                                                                            Write the expressions in radical form using the and simplify the results.                      This value is non-real.    Without parentheses around , the negative sign in this problem should be left out of the radical.       Here we will use the .                     The applies to variables in expressions just as much as it does to numbers.    Write the expressions as simplified as they can be using radicals.                             Note that in this example the exponent is only applied to the . Making this type of observation should be our first step for each of these exercises.     In this exercise, the exponent applies to both the and .      We start out as with the previous exercise. As in the previous exercise, we have a choice as to how to simplify this expression. Here we should note that we do know what the cube root of is, so we will take the path to splitting up the expression, using the , before applying the root. Here we notice that has a nice cube root, so it is good to break up the radical. Can this be simplified more? There are two ways to think about that. One way is to focus on the cube root and see that cubes to make , and the other way is to convert the cube root back to a fraction exponent and use exponent properties.     We'll use the exponent property for a fraction raised to a power.           In general, it is easier to do algebra with rational exponents on variables than with radicals of variables. You should use to convert from rational exponents to radicals on variables only as a last step in simplifying.   The describes what can be done when there is a fractional exponent and the numerator is a . The numerator doesn't have to be a though and we need guidance for that situation.   Full Radicals and Rational Exponents Property  If and are natural numbers such that is a reduced fraction, and is any non-negative real number, then . Additionally, if is an odd natural number, then even when is negative, we still have .    Guitar Frets   On a guitar, there are frets separating a note and the same note one octave higher. By moving from one fret to another that is five frets away, the frequency of the note changes by a factor of . Use the to write this number as a radical expression. And use a calculator to find this number as a decimal.    According to the ,   A calculator says . The fact that this is very close to is important. It is part of the explanation for why two notes that are five frets apart on the same string would sound good to human ears when played together as a chord (known as a fourth, in music).     By the , there are two ways to express as a radical expression: There are different times to use each formula. In general, use for variables and for numbers.        Consider the expression . Use both versions of the to explain why says that with numbers, is preferred.    Consider the expression . Use both versions of the to explain why says that with variables, is preferred.          The expression can be evaluated in the following two ways. The calculation using worked with smaller numbers and can be done without a calculator. This is why we made the general recommendation in .    The expression can be evaluated in the following two ways. In this case, the simplification using is just shorter looking and easier to write. This is why we made the general recommendation in .         Simplify the expressions using .                         We will use the second part of the , since this expression only involves a number base (not variable).             In this problem the negative can be associated with either the numerator or the denominator, but not both. We choose the numerator.

Learners of these simplifications often find it challenging, so we now include a many examples of varying difficulty.    Use exponent properties in to simplify the expressions, and write all final versions using radicals.                                                                                                                  Use the radical properties in to simplify the following expressions, answering with positive rational exponents only (no radicals).                                                              We will end a with a short application of rational exponents. Kepler's Laws of Orbital Motion describe how planets orbit stars and how satellites orbit planets. In particular, his third law has a rational exponent, which we will now explore.   Kepler and the Satellite   Kepler's third law of motion says that for objects with a roughly circular orbit that the time (in hours) that it takes to make one full revolution around the planet, , is proportional to three-halves power of the distance (in kilometers) from the center of the planet to the satellite, . For the Earth, it looks like this: In this case, both and are constants. stands for the universal gravitational constant where is about   and stands for the mass of the Earth where is about   . Inputting these values into this formula yields a simplified version that looks like this:   Most satellites orbit in what is called low Earth orbit , including the international space station which orbits at about  340  above from Earth's surface. The Earth's average radius is about  6380  . Find the period of the international space station.    The formula has already been identified, but the input takes just a little thought. The formula uses as the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite, so to find we need to combine the radius of the Earth and the distance to the satellite above the surface of the Earth.  Now we can input this value into the formula and evaluate. The formula tells us that it takes a little more than an hour and a half for the ISS to orbit the Earth! That works out to 15 or 16 sunrises per day.          Raising a number to a reciprocal power (like or ) is the same as doing what other thing to that number?      When the exponent on an expression is a fraction like , which part of the fraction is essentially the index of a radical?       Review and Warmup    Use the properties of exponents to simplify the expression. If there are any exponents in your answer, they should be positive.

One way is to focus on the cube root and see that cubes to make , and the other way is to convert the cube root back to a fraction exponent and use exponent properties.

Inputting these values into this formula yields a simplified version that looks like this:   Most satellites orbit in what is called low Earth orbit , including the international space station which orbits at about  340  above from Earth's surface. The Earth's average radius is about  6380  . Find the period of the international space station.    The formula has already been identified, but the input takes just a little thought. The formula uses as the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite, so to find we need to combine the radius of the Earth and the distance to the satellite above the surface of the Earth.  Now we can input this value into the formula and evaluate. The formula tells us that it takes a little more than an hour and a half for the ISS to orbit the Earth!

The basic strategy to solve radical equations is to isolate the radical on one side of the equation and then raise to a power on both sides to cancel the radical.   Alternative Video Lessons      Solving Radical Equations   Radical Equation  equation radical  radical equation   A radical equation is an equation in which there is a variable inside at least one radical.    Examples include the equations and .   The formula is used to calculate the period of a pendulum and is attributed to the scientist Christiaan Huygens . In the formula, stands for the pendulum's period (how long one back-and-forth oscillation takes) in seconds, stands for the pendulum's length in meters, and is approximately  9.8  which is the gravitational acceleration constant on Earth.  An engineer is designing a pendulum. Its period must be seconds. How long should the pendulum's length be?  We will substitute into the formula for and also the value of , and then solve for : To build a pendulum with a period of seconds, its length should be approximately meters.    Squaring both sides of an equation is dangerous, as it could create extraneous solutions , which will not make the equation true. For example, if we extraneous solutions square both sides of , we have: By squaring both sides of an equation, we can sometimes turn a false equation into a true one. This is why we must check solutions when we square both sides of an equation.     Solve the equation for .    We will isolate the radical first, and then square both sides. Because we squared both sides of an equation, we must check the solution. So, is the solution to the equation .      Solve the equation for .    First, isolate the radical and square both sides. Because we squared both sides of an equation, we must check the solution. Thus, the potential solution is actually extraneous and we have no real solutions to the equation . The solution set is the empty set, . empty set      In the previous example, it would be legitimate to observe that there are no solutions at earlier stages. From the very beginning, how could plus a positive quantity result in ? Or at the second step, since square roots are non-negative, how could a square root equal ?  You do not have to be able to make these observations. If you follow the general steps for solving radical equations and you remember to check the possible solutions you find, then that will be enough.   Sometimes, we need to square both sides of an equation twice before finding the solutions, like in the next example.    Solve the equation for .    We cannot isolate two radicals, so we will simply square both sides, and later try to isolate the remaining radical. Because we squared both sides of an equation, we must check the solution. So is the solution. The solution set is .    Let's look at an example of solving an equation with a cube root. There is very little difference between solving an equation with one cube root and solving an equation with one square root. Instead of squaring both sides, you cube both sides.    Solve for in .     Unlike squaring both sides of an equation, raising both sides of an equation to the 3rd power will not create extraneous solutions. It's still good practice to check solution, though. This part is left as exercise.    For summary reference, here is the general procedure for solving a radical equation.   Solving Radical Equations  solving radical equations   A basic strategy to solve radical equations is to take the following steps:   Isolate a radical on one side of the equation.    Raise both sides of the equation to a power to cancel the radical.    If there is still a radical in the equation, repeat the isolation and raising to a power.    Once the remaining equation has no radicals, solve it.    Check any and all solutions. Be aware that there may be extraneous solutions .         Solving a Radical Equation with More Than One Variable  We also need to be able to solve radical equations with other variables, like in the next example. The strategy is the same: isolate the radical, and then raise both sides to a certain power to cancel the radical.    Solve for in the formula . (This is the formula for a the period of a swinging pendulum whose length is , on earth where the acceleration from earth's gravity is .)           The study of black holes has resulted in some interesting mathematics. One fundamental concept about black holes is that there is a distance close enough to the black hole that not even light can escape, called the Schwarzschild radius or the event horizon radius. To find the Schwarzschild radius, , we set the formula for the escape velocity equal to the speed of light, , and we get which we need to solve for . Note that is a constant, and is the mass of the black hole.    We will start by taking the equation and applying our standard radical-equation-solving techniques. Isolate the radical and square both sides: So, the Schwarzschild radius can be found using the formula .        What is the basic approach to solving a radical equation?      What is it called when you have an equation to solve, and you use some algebra steps that lead you to having a small list of possible solutions, but one or more of them are not actually solutions?

  "body": " Fractions and Fraction Arithmetic   The word fraction comes from the Latin word fractio , which means break into pieces . For thousands of years, cultures from all over the world have used fractions to understand parts of a whole.   Alternative Video Lesson      Visualizing Fractions   Parts of a Whole  One approach to understanding fractions is to think of them as parts of a whole.   In , we see whole divided into parts. Since Denominator  parts are shaded, we have an illustration of the fraction . The Numerator  denominator  tells us how many parts to cut up the whole; since we Fraction denominator have parts, they're called sevenths . The numerator   Fraction numerator tells us how many sevenths to consider.   Representing as parts of a whole.   a rectangle that is seven times as wide as it is tall; the entire rectangle is shaded; there is a 1 in the center of the rectangle; to its right, it is labeled 'one whole'; another rectangle of the same size is aligned directly below the first rectangle; it is subdivided equally into seven squares; the first three squares are shaded; there is a 1\/7 in the center of each of the first three squares; to its right, it is labeled 'three sevenths'       A Fraction as Parts of a Whole    To visualize the fraction you might cut a rectangle into equal parts, and then count up of them.             You could cut a rectangle into equal pieces, and then of them would represent         We can also locate fractions on number lines. When ticks are equally spread apart, as in , each tick represents a fraction.   Representing on a number line.   a number line with a curved arrow emanating from 0 and landing to the right at 1\/7, then again from 1\/7 to 2\/7, and again from 2\/7 to 3\/7       A Fraction on a Number Line    In the given number line, what fraction is marked?    a number line with -1, 0, and 1 marked; there are evenly spaced ticks, with eight ticks between -1 and 0, eight between 0 and 1, and so on; there is a dot marked at the fifth tick to the right from 0         There are subdivisions between and and the mark is at the fifth subdivision. So the mark is of the way from to and therefore represents the fraction          Division  Fractions can also be understood through division.   For example, we can view the fraction as divided into equal parts, as in . Just one of those parts represents .   Representing on a number line.   a number line with a ruler superimposed over the segment from 0 to 3; the ruler is subdivided into seven pieces; an arrow points down from the first ruler tick to a point on the number line that is marked 3\/7       Seeing a Fraction as Division Arithmetic    The fraction can be thought of as dividing the whole number into equal-sized parts.             Since means the same as it can be thought of as dividing into equal parts.           Equivalent Fractions  It's common to have two fractions that represent the same amount. Consider and represented in various ways in Figures .    and as equal parts of a whole   one rectangle that is five times as wide as it is tall; the entire rectangle is shaded; there is a 1 in the center of the rectangle; a second rectangle that is also five times as wide as it is tall; it is subdivided equally into five squares; the first two squares are shaded; there is a 1\/5 in the center of each of the first two squares; a third rectangle that is also five times as wide as it is tall; it is subdivided equally into fifteen adjacent rectangles; the first six of these smaller rectangles are shaded; there is a 1\/15 in the center of each of the first six smaller rectangles      and as equal on a number line   a number line with a curved arrow emanating from 0 and landing to the right at 1\/5, then again from 1\/5 to 2\/5; there is a number line with a curved arrow emanating from 0 and landing to the right at 1\/15, then again from 1\/15 to 2\/15, then again from 2\/15 to 3\/15, then again from 3\/15 to 4\/15, then again from 4\/15 to 5\/15, and then again from 5\/15 to 6\/15      and as equal quotients   a number line with a ruler superimposed over the segment from 0 to 2; the ruler is subdivided into five pieces; an arrow points down from the first ruler tick to a point on the number line that is marked 2\/5; there is a second number line with a ruler superimposed over the segment from 0 to 6; the ruler is subdivided into fifteen pieces; an arrow points down from the first ruler tick to a point on the number line that is marked 6\/15      Those two fractions, and are equal, as those figures demonstrate. In addition, both fractions are equal to as a decimal. If we must work with this number, the fraction that uses smaller numbers, , is preferable. Working with smaller numbers decreases the likelihood of making a human arithmetic error and it also increases the chances that you might make useful observations about the nature of that number.   So if you are handed a fraction like , it is important to try to Fraction reducing  reduce it to lowest terms . The most important skill you can have to help Reduced fraction you do this is to know the multiplication table well. If you know it well, you know that and , so you can break down the numerator and denominator Reducing a fraction that way. Both the numerator and denominator are divisible by , so they can be Simplifying a fraction  factored out and then as factors, cancel out.       Reducing Fractions    Reduce these fractions into lowest terms.           With we have which reduces to            With we have which reduces to            With we have which reduces to         Sometimes it is useful to do the opposite of reducing a fraction, and build up the fraction to use larger numbers.   Building Up a Fraction    Sayid scored on a recent exam. Build up this fraction so that the denominator is so that Sayid can understand what percent score he earned.        To change the denominator from to it needs to be multiplied by So we calculate   So the fraction is equivalent to (This means Sayid scored an )          Multiplying with Fractions   Suppose a recipe calls for cup of milk, but we'd like to quadruple the recipe (make it four times as big). We'll need four times as much milk, and one way to measure this out is to fill a measuring cup to full, four times:   four measuring cups, each filled two-thirds with liquid    When you count up the shaded thirds, there are eight of them. So multiplying by the whole number , the result is . Mathematically:     Multiplying a Fraction and a Whole Number  When you multiply a whole number by a fraction, you may just multiply the whole number by the numerator and leave the denominator alone. In other words, as long as is not , then a whole number and a fraction multiply this way:     We could also use multiplication to decrease amounts. Suppose we needed to cut the recipe down to just one fifth. Instead of four of the cup milk, we need one fifth of the cup milk. So instead of multiplying by , we multiply by . But how much is of cup?   If we cut the measuring cup into five equal vertical strips along with the three equal horizontal strips, then in total there are subdivisions of the cup. Two of those sections represent of the cup.   a measuring cup divided evenly into three horizontal sections, but also evenly into five vertical sections; in total, there are fifteen sections; the two that correspond to the lower two-thirds and leftmost one-fifth are shaded      In the end, we have of a cup. The denominator came from multiplying and , the denominators of the fractions we had to multiply. The numerator came from multiplying and , the numerators of the fractions we had to multiply.        Multiplication with Fractions  Multiplication of fractions  Fraction multiplication   As long as and are not , then fractions multiply this way:      Fraction Multiplication    Simplify these fraction products.           Multiplying numerators gives and multiplying denominators gives The answer is            Before we multiply fractions, note that reduces to and reduces to So we just have            Multiplying numerators gives and multiplying denominators gives The result should be negative, so the answer is            Before we multiply fractions, note that reduces to So we have Both the numerator of the first fraction and denominator of the second fraction are divisible by so it helps to reduce both fractions accordingly and get Both the denominator of the first fraction and numerator of the second fraction are divisible by so it helps to reduce both fractions accordingly and get Now we are just multiplying by so the result is           Division with Fractions  How does division with fractions work? Are we able to compute\/simplify each of these examples?                        We know that when we divide something by , this is the same as multiplying it by . Conversely, dividing a number or expression by is the same as multiplying by , or just . The more general property is that when we divide a number or expression by , this is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal .   Division with Fractions   As long as , and are not , then division with fractions works this way:      With our examples from the beginning of this subsection:                           Fraction Division    Simplify these fraction division expressions.                                                      Adding and Subtracting Fractions  With whole numbers and integers, operations of addition and subtraction are relatively straightforward. The situation is almost as straightforward with fractions if the two fractions have the same denominator . Consider In the same way that tacos and tacos make tacos, we have:    Adding\/Subtracting with Fractions Having the Same Denominator  Addition of fractions with the same denominator  Denominator adding and subtracting fractions with the same  Fraction adding and subtracting with the same denominator   To add or subtract two fractions having the same denominator, keep that denominator, and add or subtract the numerators. If it's possible, useful, or required of you, simplify the result by reducing to lowest terms.     Fraction Addition and Subtraction    Add or subtract these fractions.           Since the denominators are both we can add the numerators: The answer is            Since the denominators are both we can subtract the numerators: The answer is but that reduces to         Whenever we'd like to combine fractional amounts that don't represent the same number of parts of a whole (that is, when the denominators are different), finding sums and differences is more complicated.   Quarters and Dimes  Find the sum . Does this seem intimidating? Consider this:    of a dollar is a quarter, and so of a dollar is cents.     of a dollar is a dime, and so of a dollar is cents.     So if you know what to look for, the expression is like adding cents and cents, which gives you cents. As a fraction of one dollar, that is . So we can report . (Although we should probably reduce that last fraction to .)   This example was not something you can apply to other fraction addition situations, because the denominators here worked especially well with money amounts. But there is something we can learn here. The fraction was equivalent to , and the other fraction was equivalent to . These equivalent fractions have the same denominator and are therefore easy to add. What we saw happen was:   This realization gives us a strategy for adding (or subtracting) fractions.   Adding\/Subtracting Fractions with Different Denominators  Addition of fractions with different denominators  Denominator adding and subtracting fractions with different  Fraction adding and subtracting with the different denominators   To add (or subtract) generic fractions together, use their denominators to find a common denominator . This means some whole number that is a whole multiple of Fraction common denominator both of the original denominators. Then rewrite the two fractions as equivalent  Common denominator fractions that use this common denominator. Write the result keeping that Denominator common denominator and adding (or subtracting) the numerators. Reduce the fraction if that is useful or required.  Among all possible common denominators for two fractions, one option will be smaller than Denominator least common all others. This is called the least common denominator . Least common denominator (LCD)      Let's add . The denominators are and , so the number would be a good common denominator.     Using Some Flour    A chef had cups of flour and needed to use cup to thicken a sauce. How much flour is left?        We need to compute The denominators are and One common denominator is so we move to rewrite each fraction using as the denominator:   The numerical result is but a pure number does not answer this question. The amount of flour remaining is  cups .          Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions  A simple recipe for bread contains only a few ingredients:     tablespoons yeast     tablespoons kosher salt     cups unbleached, all-purpose flour (more for dusting)    Each ingredient is listed as a mixed number that quickly communicates how many Fraction mixed number whole amounts and how many parts are needed. It's useful for quickly communicating a practical Mixed numbers amount of something you are cooking with, measuring on a ruler, purchasing at the grocery store, etc. But it causes trouble in an algebra class. The number means one and one half . So really, The trouble is that with , you have two numbers written right next to each other. Normally with two math expressions written right next to each other, they should be multiplied , not added . But with a mixed number, they should be added.   Fortunately we just reviewed how to add fractions. If we need to do any arithmetic with a mixed number like , we can treat it as and simplify to get a nice fraction instead: . A fraction like is called an improper fraction because it's actually larger Fraction improper than .

By the pie chart, the school has white students, and black students.  We will use subtraction to find the difference:            A town has residents in total, of which are Latino Americans. How many Latino Americans reside in this town?  There are Latino Americans residing in this town.        When we use the word of in expressions like of , we can translate of into the multiplication symbol.  In this problem, to find of , we compute:   There are Latino Americans residing in this town.           A company received a grant, and decided to spend of this grant in research and development next year. Out of the money set aside for research and development, will be used to buy new equipment. What fraction of the grant will be used to buy new equipment?  of the grant will be used to buy new equipment.        For this problem, we are trying to find of . The word of implies multiplication:   So of the grant will be used to buy new equipment.           A food bank just received kilograms of emergency food. Each family in need is to receive kilograms of food. How many families can be served with the kilograms of food?  families can be served with the kilograms of food.        We can address this problem as repeatedly taking away kilograms from kilograms, which implies a division problem:   families can be served with the kilograms of food.           A construction team maintains a -mile-long sewage pipe. Each day, the team can cover of a mile. How many days will it take the team to complete the maintenance of the entire sewage pipe?  It will take the team days to complete maintaining the entire sewage pipe.        In this problem, the team maintains miles of sewage pipe every day, until they complete all miles. This is like repeatedly taking away miles from miles, a division problem.   It will take the team days to complete maintaining the entire sewage pipe.           A child is stacking up tiles. Each tile s height is of a centimeter. How many layers of tiles are needed to reach centimeters in total height?  To reach the total height of centimeters, layers of tiles are needed.        In this problem, each layer of tile is centimeters tall. The child will keep stacking up layers until the total height reaches centimeters. This is like asking how many centimeters are there in centimeters, a division problem.   To reach the total height of centimeters, layers of tiles are needed.           A restaurant made cups of pudding for a festival.  Customers at the festival will be served of a cup of pudding per serving. How many customers can the restaurant serve at the festival with the cups of pudding?  The restaurant can serve customers at the festival with the cups of pudding.        There are a total of cups of pudding, with each serving being cup. To find how many servings can be served, we need to find how many cups are there in cups, a division problem:   The restaurant can serve customers at the festival with the cups of pudding.   Shortcut  Since each serving has cup, we know each cup has servings. So cups has servings.           A piece of lumber in your garage is inches long. A second is inches long. If you lay them end to end, what will the total length be?  The total length will be inches.        To find the total length in inches, we add the two lengths together.   So the total length is inches.           A piece of lumber in your garage is inches long. A second is inches long. If you lay them end to end, what will the total length be?  The total length will be inches.        To find the total length in inches, we add the two lengths together.   So the total length is inches.           Each page of a book consists of a header, a footer and the middle part. The header is inches in height; the footer is inches in height; and the middle part is inches in height.  What is the total height of each page in this book? Use mixed number in your answer if needed.  Each page in this book is inches in height.        We add up the height of the header, middle part and footer to find the total height of a page:   Each page in this book is inches in height.           To pave the road on Ellis Street, the crew used tons of cement on the first day, and used tons on the second day. How many tons of cement were used in all?  tons of cement were used in all.        This problem is obviously an addition problem.  To add mixed number, we break each mixed number into an integer and a fraction, and then add up integers and fractions separately.   tons of cement were used in all.           When driving on a high way, noticed a sign saying exit to Johnstown is miles away, while exit to Jerrystown is miles away. How far is Johnstown from Jerrystown?  Johnstown and Jerrystown are miles apart.        To find the distance between Johnstown and Jerrystown, we need to find the difference between their distance. This implies subtraction. We could treat subtraction as adding a negative :   From here, there are two methods to continue.   Method 1  We can split  from the integer, and do :   Note that we changed to .   Method2  We could simply change the whole number into a fraction without splitting  :   ran more miles than .           A cake recipe needs cups of flour. Using this recipe, to bake cakes, how many cups of flour are needed?  To bake cakes, cups of flour are needed.        Each cake needs cups of flour. To find how many cups of flour are needed to bake cakes, we use multiplication:   To bake cakes, cups of flour are needed.          Sketching Fractions    Sketch a number line showing each fraction.

  "title": "Order of Operations",
  "body": " Order of Operations   When you write something down, it's important that the people who read it will understand what you actually meant. But language can be ambiguous. If we say in English, two times three squared , do we mean that:    is multiplied by , and then the result is squared? That would mean first we have , and then we square to end with .    Or that is multiplied by three squared ? That would mean first we square to get , and then we multiply by to end with .   So it makes a difference, and the English phrase two times three squared is arguably ambiguous.  English is allowed to be ambiguous. But math needs to be unambiguous and mean the same thing for everyone who reads it. So for this reason, there are some rules that we've all agreed to that control what a math expression really means. These rules are called the order of operations , which we review here.   Alternative Video Lesson      Grouping Symbols  Consider the expression . There are two math operations here: at some point two things will be multiplied, and at some point something will be raised to a power. The result depends on which operation you decide to do first: If you multiply , and then square the result, you end with . If you square , and then multiply that result by , you end with . So if we want all people everywhere to interpret in the same way, then only one of these can be correct.  One tool that we have to clearly tell readers which thing to do first is a pair of grouping symbols, like parentheses and brackets. If you intend to do the multiplication first, then writing clearly tells your reader to do that. And if you intend to execute the power first, then writing clearly tells your reader to do that.  To visualize the difference between or , consider these garden plots:   3 is squared, then doubled:   two squares, side by side; each square is labeled as 3 yd wide and 3 yd high, and labeled as having area 9 yd^2     3 is doubled, then squared:   a square whose width is labeled as 2*3 yd = 6 yd wide and whose height is also 6 yd; the square's area is labeled as being area 36 yd^2      If we find , we have the area of one of the small square garden plots on the left. Then if we double that, we have , the area of the entire left garden plot.  But if we find , then first we are doubling . So we are getting the area of a large square garden plot whose sides are twice as long. We end up with the area of the entire garden plot on the right.  The point is that these amounts are different.     Calculate the value of respecting the order that the grouping symbols are telling you to execute the arithmetic operations.        The grouping symbols tell us what to work on first. In this exercise, we have grouping symbols within grouping symbols, so any operation in there (the addition) should be executed first:           Order of Operations  If math expressions used grouping symbols for every arithmetic operation, we wouldn't need order of operations . Some computer systems work that way, requiring the use of grouping symbols all the time. But it is more common to allow math expressions that don't have grouping symbols everywhere, like . Should the addition be done first, or should the multiplication be done first? We have a set of rules the world has agreed to, known as the order of operations . They tell us what to do first.  The order of operations is nothing more than an agreement that we all have made to prioritize doing arithmetic operations in a certain order.   Order of Operations  Order of operations    (P)arentheses and other grouping symbols  Symbol grouping  Grouping symbol  Grouping symbols group the expression inside them, and the arithmetic within that group needs to be done first.    (E)xponentiation  After grouping symbols, exponentiation has the highest priority. Raise things to powers before doing any other arithmetic.    (M)ultiplication, (D)ivision, and Negation  After all exponentiation is done, start doing multiplication, division, and negation. These things all have equal priority. If there are more than one of them in your expression, do these things in order from left to right as you would naturally read the expression.    (A)ddition and (S)ubtraction  After all other arithmetic is done, addition and subtraction are all that is left. They have equal priority. If there are more than one of them in your expression, do these things in order from left to right as you would naturally read the expression.     To help remember the order of operations, consider the acronym PEMDAS . You might use mnemonic devices to help remember this such as Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally , People Eat More Donuts After School , etc.  We'll start with a few examples that only invoke a few operations each.   Use the order of operations to simplify the following expressions.    . With this expression, we have addition and multiplication. The order of operations says the multiplication has higher priority, so do that first:      . According to the order of operations, the first thing to do is the division. After that, we'll apply the addition and subtraction working left to right:      . This expression only has subtraction and addition. These operations tie for priority (even though A comes before S in PEMDAS ). So we work left to right to do them:      . This expression has only division and multiplication. Again, we have two operations that tie for priority, so we do them in order from left to right:      . Here we have addition inside parentheses, and an exponent of outside. We must do the arithmetic inside the parentheses first:      . This expression has multiplication and an exponent. There are parentheses, but no operation inside them. Parentheses used this way are just to make it clear that the and are separate numbers, not to be confused with the number . Exponentiation has the higher priority, so we'll do that part first, and then multiply:        There are several different ways to write multiplication. We can use the symbols , , and to mean multiplication. We can also write two things right next to each other with no symbol in between them to mean multiplication. That is what is happening in Item , where the is written right next to the with no symbol in between.  Using a symbol for multiplication is called explicit multiplication and not writing Multiplication explicit any symbol at all is called implicit multiplication . For this textbook, explicit and Multiplication implicit implicit multiplication have the same priority in the order of operations. However there are some conventions out in the real world where implicit multiplication has a higher priority in the order of operations than explicit multiplication. You may have seen memes with expressions like that play on how the real world has more than one convention for the order of operations.     Practice with order of operations    Simplify this expression one step at a time, using the order of operations.                                                       Simplify        With the expression we ll simplify what s inside the parentheses according to the order of operations, and then take divided by that expression as our last step:            Simplify        The expression has two sets of parentheses, so our first step will be to simplify what s inside each of those first according to the order of operations. Once we ve done that, we ll apply the exponent and then finally divide:           Absolute Value and Implied Grouping  Grouping symbols are more than just parentheses and brackets. Each of the following operations implies some grouping.     Absolute Value Bars  Absolute value implied grouping  Absolute value bars group the expression inside just like a set of parentheses would. In the expression , the first thing to do is subtract since that is inside the absolute value bars.    Radicals  Radical implied grouping  The same is true with a radical symbol. Everything inside the radical is grouped. For example with , the first arithmetic to do is subtract .    Fraction Bars  Fraction implied grouping  A fraction bar can create two groups, one in the numerator and one in the denominator. With the expression , the first arithmetic to take care of is adding and subtracting . These two groups can be worked on separately in any order.    Exponents  Exponent implied grouping  Content that is inside an exponent is treated as one group, as with . In that example, the first arithmetic to take care of is multiplying .     Each of these implied groupings also ask you to do something once the arithmetic on the inside is completed. Actually taking the absolute value or the square root, perhaps. Doing the division in the case of a fraction. Raising something to a power. But before doing those things, all of the arithmetic inside the groups should be take care of.   Use the order of operations to simplify the following expressions.    . The absolute value bars group the so we must do that subtraction first. Then we take the absolute value and continue: It would be a mistake to subtract first, because that is multiplied by the . So subtracting would violate the order of operations.     . The radical is grouping , which must be simplified first. Then we take the square root and continue:      . We recognize that the fraction bar is creating two groups. We should simplify the numerator and denominator separately according to the order of operations, and proceed from there:        Implied Grouping    Use the order of operations to evaluate         We start by identifying the innermost, highest priority operations:            Simplify        To simplify this expression, the first thing we want to recognize is the role of the main fraction bar, which groups the numerator and denominator. This implies we ll simplify the numerator and denominator separately according to the order of operations, and then reduce the fraction that results:           Understanding versus  We noted in the order of operations that using the minus sign to negate a number has the same priority as multiplication and division.  How would you write a math expression that takes the number and squares it? Is it OK to write ? How about ?  These expressions mean very different things. The second option, is squaring the number . The parentheses make this clear. The result is .  The first expression is different. There are two actions here: a negation and exponentiation. According to the order of operations, the exponentiation has higher priority, so we should do first. and this is not the same as , which is positive  .   Negative Numbers Raised to Powers  You may find yourself needing to raise a negative number to a power, and using a calculator to do the work for you. If you do not understand the issue described above, then you may get incorrect results.   Entering -4^2 into a calculator or computer will result in .    Entering (-4)^2 into a calculator or computer will result in .   Try entering these into your own calculator.    Negating and Raising to Powers    Compute the following. In each part, the first expression asks you to exponentiate and then negate the result. The second expression has a negative number raised to a power.    and             and     and             and     and             and         You might notice in that and each have the same result, . It's true that the results are the same, but the two expressions say different things. With , you raise to a power first, then negate. With , you negate first, then raise to a power. It's like two different roads that happen to lead to the same place, which happens sometimes.      Skills    Use the order of operations to simplify the expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Use the order of operations to simplify the expression that has grouping symbols.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Use the order of operations to simplify the expression that has absolute value or implied grouping.

One of the fundamental skills we have for simplifying expressions is combining like terms .   Alternative Video Lesson      Identifying Terms    In an algebraic expression, the terms  Terms are quantities being added together. Terms of algebraic expressions     Note that terms are not the same thing as factors , which are quantities being Factors multiplied together. Factors are studied more later in this book.    List the terms in the expression .    The expression has two terms that are being added, and .    When an expression has subtraction, we can rewrite the it using addition of a negative to make it easier to see exactly what the terms are.    List the terms in the expression .    We can rewrite this expression as to see that the terms are , , and . Note that the third term is , not just .      List the terms in the expression .    This expression has four terms:  3  ,  2  ,  -3  , and  2  .       List the terms in the expression        The terms are  and          Combining Like Terms  Combining like terms  If you have , it is natural to add those together to get 5 . That works because their units ( ) are the same. The same idea applies to other terms, even ones that don't have units. For example, with , we have  things and then more of those things . All together, we have of those things. So is the same as .  Terms in an algebraic expression that can be combined by adding them together into one new Terms like term are called like terms . Like terms    Sometimes like terms use a common variable, like how has terms that each use . This simplifies to .    Sometimes like terms use the same units, like how has terms that each use . This simplifies to 5 .    Sometimes like terms have something else in common, like how  Like radicals has terms that each use . This simplifies to . Radicals like        In the expressions below, look for like terms and then simplify where possible Algebraic expression simplifying by adding or subtracting. Simplifying algebraic expressions                                     We can combine terms with the same units, but we cannot combine terms with distinct units such as minutes and feet.         cannot be combined          cannot be combined     cannot be combined            One of the examples from was . The units on these two terms look similar, but they are different. 16 is a measurement of how much area something has. 4 is a measurement of how long something is. illustrates this.   There is no way to add 16 to 4 .   a four-by-four square, illustrating 16 square feet, alongside a line that is four feet long       Simplify each expression by combining like terms (if possible).               This expression has two like terms, and , which we can combine. We have to subtract , which is straightforward since they have the same denominator. We don't combine and because and are different variables.    This expression cannot be simplified because the variable parts are not the same. We cannot add -terms with -terms just like we cannot add feet (a measure of length) with square feet (a measure of area).    There aren't any like terms.    The two terms are like terms. To combine them, we need to add . For a review of adding fractions with different denominators, see . In this case, So .    There are two like terms: and . A lonely is usually just written as , but we can think of it as . So we are combining and and we need to subtract . Our two terms combine to make . There was another term when this started and the final simplified expression is .    This expression can be thought of as . Subtracting decimals , the result is . So we have .          Simplify each expression by combining like terms (if possible).           Think of this expression as and simplify to get            This expression has two like terms that can be combined: and To combine them, we need to add the fractions   So And together with the third term, the answer is            In this expression we can combine the -terms. We need to subtract the fractions   So And together with the third term, the answer is            This expression cannot be simplified further because there are not any like terms.           Applications  The perimeter of a shape is the length of a strip of tape that could be taped tightly around the shape. When a shape has straight side edges, the perimeter comes from adding all of the side lengths together. This can lead to like terms that can be combined.    Find the perimeter of this shape, which is not drawn to scale. Simplify the perimeter expression as much as possible.   a five-sided shape whose sides are labeled 2x, 3y, 1.5x, 5y, and x      The perimeter is the result from adding the five sides together: . There are three -terms that sum to , and two -terms that sum to . So the perimeter is .       Find the perimeter of this shape, which is not drawn to scale. Simplify the perimeter expression as much as possible.    a six-sided shape whose sides are labeled 3\/2 A, 2\/3 B, 3\/4 C, 2A, 2\/3 B, and 8\/17 C         The perimeter is the result from adding the six sides together: There are two -terms, two -terms, and two -terms. We need to find:   So the perimeter is        Sometimes it makes sense to add two algebra expressions together, and that may give an opportunity to combine like terms.    A chemist has a bottle with 1.2 of water mixed with 0.3 of gasoline. At this time, they have forgotten the density of water (in ) and the density of gasoline (also in ) so they use and as variables for these densities. This means is the total mass of this mixture, in grams.  There is a second bottle, with 0.9 of water mixed with 0.5 of gasoline. The chemist pours it all together. What is the mass of the combined mixture?    The first mass is grams, and the second mass is grams. So together, the mass in grams is:         What should you be aware of when there is subtraction in an algebraic expression and you are identifying its terms?       Describe at least two different ways in which a pair of terms would be considered to be like terms .       What might help when you are combining like terms, and one of the terms is a lonely variable like or ?

The perimeter is the result from adding the four sides together: There are two -terms and two -terms. We combine each pair of like terms and the perimeter is             a quadrilateral whose sides are labeled ((5\/6)*P), ((7\/8)*F), (F), and ((9\/8)*P).         The perimeter is the result from adding the four sides together: There are two -terms and two -terms. We combine each pair of like terms and the perimeter is             a quadrilateral whose sides are labeled (v), (v), (K), (3.5*K), (4.4*v), and (11*K).         The perimeter is the result from adding the six sides together: There are three -terms and three -terms. We combine each triple of like terms and the perimeter is             a quadrilateral whose sides are labeled (e), (e), (4.7*Q), (8.7*e), (9.9*Q), and (90*Q).         The perimeter is the result from adding the six sides together: There are three -terms and three -terms. We combine each triple of like terms and the perimeter is             a quadrilateral whose sides are labeled ((1\/3)*W), ((2\/3)*H), ((8\/9)*H), and (W).         The perimeter is the result from adding the six sides together: There are two -terms, two -terms, and two -terms. We combine each pair of like terms and the perimeter is             a quadrilateral whose sides are labeled ((1\/7)*f), ((2\/5)*u), ((3\/4)*b), and (b).         The perimeter is the result from adding the six sides together: There are two -terms, two -terms, and two -terms. We combine each pair of like terms and the perimeter is          Office Lunch    Every Friday, an office supervisor provides catered lunches for everyone working in the office. People can order a sandwich (costs dollars) or a burrito (costs dollars).  One week, the office ordered sandwiches and burritos. So the bill came to dollars.    The next week, the office ordered sandwiches and burritos. How much was the bill that week, in dollars?          What was the combined bill for these two weeks?               Pies and Cakes    Donald and Mateo are co-owners of a pastry shop. Donald bakes pies and Mateo bakes cakes. Donald is able to bake pies each day he works and Mateo is able to bake cakes each day he works.  One month, Donald worked days and Mateo worked days. That month they produced baked goods in total.    The next month, Donald worked days and Mateo worked days. How many baked goods did they produce that month?          How many baked goods was that in total for those two months?               Sportsball    Sportsball is a game similar to basketball. There are three ways for a team to score points: a long field goal earns points; a short field goal earns points; and a penalty shot earns points.  In the first half of one game, a team scored penalty shots, long field goals, and short field goals. So they earned points.    In the second half of the game, that same team scored penalty shots, long field goals, and short field goals. How many points did they earn during the second half?          How many points did the team score in total?               Metal Recycling    A metals recycling plant makes its revenue from selling aluminum at dollars per ton, steel at dollars per ton, and tin at dollars per ton. One week, they processed tons of aluminum, tons of steel, and tons of tin. So they generated dollars in revenue.    The next week, they processed tons of aluminum, tons of steel, and tons of tin. How much revenue (in dollars) did this generate that week?          How much revenue (in dollars) was that in total those two weeks?                 "

That result is the same as if we'd started with three apples and then added two more. This is a feature of numbers and arithmetic that we will formalize in this section, along with a few other features. Understanding these well will help us solve more equations later.   Alternative Video Lesson      Identities and Inverses  Identity  We start with some definitions. The number is called the additive identity . It has this name because Additive identity adding to a number does not change that number's identity . Identity additive If you were playing a game where you needed to add something to , but you Addition identity property of didn't want to change the value, then you would add : Identity property of addition  Adding the additive identity to a number does not change that number.  If the sum of two numbers is the additive identity ( ) then those two numbers Addition inverse property of are called additive inverses of each other. Additive inverse Imagine playing a game where you have a number like , and you need to add something Inverse additive to it to get . You would add : Opposite  Inverse property of addition  It works the other way too when starting with a negative number. Now imagine starting with and you need to add something to that to get . You would add : The additive inverse of a number is that same number with the opposite sign. And what makes that pair of numbers special is that they add to .  We also have the special number , which is the multiplicative identity . Multiplicative identity The special feature being highlighted is that when you multiply a number by , Identity multiplicative it does not change that number's identity . Once again, imagine you are playing a game Multiplication identity property of where your job is to multiply by something, but you actually do not want to change the number's value. Then you would multiply by : Identity property of multiplication    If the product of two numbers is the multiplicative identity ( ) then those two numbers Multiplication inverse property of are called multiplicative inverses of each other. Multiplicative inverse Strategically, what would you multiply by to get ? Inverse multiplicative You could use the fraction : Reciprocal  Inverse property of multiplication  Or what if you started with a more complicated number like ? What could you multiply that by to get ? We would use so that the negative signs cancel, and the product would be which reduces to : Notice what happens with the numerator and denominator swapping places. The multiplicative inverse of a number is also called its reciprocal .   Matching Vocabulary   Match each concept with the corresponding vocabulary term.     Add something but not change value  Additive identity    Add something and get  Additive inverse    Multiply by something but not change value  Multiplicative identity    Multiply by something and get  Multiplicative inverse      Matching Identities and Inverses   Match each description of a number on the left with a number on the right.

Does the result change if we multiply the width by the length?   Horizontal and Vertical Rectangles   two rectangles; the left rectangle is 3 cm wide by 2 cm high; its area is marked by Area=3*2=6; the right rectangle is 2 cm wide by 3 cm high; its area is marked by Area=2*3=6     We can see that . If we write the length of a rectangle as and the width as , we can write . The fact that we can reverse the order of multiplication is known as the commutative property of multiplication . There is a similar property for addition, which you can see in the equation . It's called the commutative property of addition . Addition commutative property of However, subtraction and division do not have the commutative property, because for example and .    Associative Property  Associative property  Instead of a rectangle, consider a 3D rectangular prism with depth , width , and height . To compute the volume of this prism, we multiply the depth, width, and height together. In the following figure, on the left side, we multiply the width and depth first, and then multiply the height. On the right side, we multiply the width and height first, and then multiply the depth. Either way, the final result is the same.      a rectangular prism; its length is 4 cm, width is 3 cm, and height is 2 cm; one face representing the width and depth is highlighted        a rectangular prism; its length is 4 cm, width is 3 cm, and height is 2 cm; one face representing the width and height is highlighted      What this shows us is . We haven't changed the order that the three variables are written left to right, but we are doing the actual multiplication in a different order. The order of operations requires multiplication inside the parentheses to happen first. This feature of numbers is known as the associative property of multiplication . There is a similar property for addition, which you can see in the equation . Note again that the left-to-right order that the numbers are written is the same on either side. But the grouping symbols get us to actually do the addition in a different order. This property is called the associative property of addition . Addition associative property of Subtraction and division do not have an associative property, because for example and .    Distributive Property  Distributive property  The final property we'll explore is called the distributive property , which involves both multiplication and addition (or subtraction). To understand this property, consider what happens if we take bags, and each bag contains one apple and one pear. We have the same total amount of fruit as if we'd taken a bag with apples and another bag with pears. Algebraically: It helps to think of this as distributing the to the and the .  The distributive property also works with multiplication on the other side, and with subtraction: although the apples and pears metaphor may be harder to make sense of.  And the distributive property works with division too, when there is only one term in the denominator:     Summary of Algebraic Properties   Algebraic Properties  Addition commutative property of  Commutative property of addition  Addition associative property of  Associative property of addition  Multiplication commutative property of  Commutative property of multiplication  Multiplication associative property of  Associative property of multiplication  Distributive property   Let , , and be real numbers, variables, or algebraic expressions. Then the following properties hold:     Commutative Property of Multiplication       Associative Property of Multiplication       Commutative Property of Addition       Associative Property of Addition       Distributive Property     (The last two versions require .)      Practice these properties in the following exercises.   Matching Vocabulary   Match each concept with the corresponding vocabulary term.

Use the commutative property of addition to write an equivalent expression to        To use the commutative property of addition, change the order the two terms are added:      Use the associative property of addition to write an equivalent expression to        To use the associative property of addition, leave terms written in their original order, but change the grouping symbols so that a different addition has higher priority:      Use the distributive property to write an equivalent expression to that has no grouping symbols.        To use the distributive property, multiply the number outside the parentheses, with each term inside the parentheses:            Applying the Commutative, Associative, and Distributive Properties  One way we use the commutative, associative, and distributive properties is to simplify Algebraic expressions simplifying algebra expressions.   Combining like terms  Like Terms  For example, how we treat like terms (see ) is actually putting these algebra properties into practice. We combine like terms when we take an expression like and write the result as . The drawn-out formal process actually looks like this: So combining like terms is actually making use of the distributive property. In practice, it's better for you to do this the fast way. But you can grow you understanding and appreciation for algebra if you see how the above steps break things down with one official algebra property at a time.      Where possible, simplify the following expressions by combining like terms.           All three terms are like terms, so they may combined. We combine them two at a time:             The terms and are like terms, so we may combine them. Note we are using one of the subtraction versions of the distributive property.             The terms and are like terms, while the other term is different. Using the associative and commutative properties of addition early in the process allows us to place the two like terms next to each other, and then combine them:   This walkthrough uses the algebra properties cleanly and clearly one step at a time, but if you are combining like terms more quickly, there s nothing at all wrong with that.            The expression cannot be simplified as there are no like terms.          Adding Expressions  Consider adding an expression like to an expression like : Can we simplify this? It's great if you already see that the parentheses in this case can be removed and it would not change the outcome: And then using what you know about like terms, you could conclude that this is .  Several steps that are described above are sweeping things under the rug, taking multiple steps at once without really justifying why that is legal. Why exactly is it OK to just ignore those parentheses? Why is it ok to add and when they are separated with the in between? With the algebra properties, we can cleanly justify why simplifies to , explaining one step at a time. View this as three things being added, and apply associativity of addition. Once again apply associativity of addition. We won't change the order anything is written, but we will move that inner pair of parentheses. Now apply commutativity of addition. We've made noteworthy progress because the -terms are finally written close to each other. Apply associativity of addition to the inner parentheses. Apply associativity of addition again. Use the distributive property. And finally, we can just respect the order of operations and carry out the additions inside the parentheses. That was a lot to do! So it's worth repeating that it is good if you can more quickly simplify to . The above demonstrates how the algebra properties, one at a time, truly justify and validate that simplification.      Use the associative, commutative, and distributive properties to simplify the following expressions as much as possible.                                The Role of the Order of Operations  When simplifying an expression such as , we need to respect the order of operations. Since the terms inside the parentheses are not like terms, there is nothing to simplify inside the parentheses. The next highest priority operation is multiplying the by the . This must be done before anything happens with that at the far left. It is wrong to write , because that would mean we treated the addition as having higher priority than the multiplication. And that just plain violates the standard order of operations.  So the order of operations alone is not enough to simplify this expression. But the algebra properties let us rearrange things so that we can be productive. To simplify , note that there is a place where we can apply the distributive property: Now we can uses the commutative and associative properties.    Algebra Steps to Simplify an Expression  Simplifying algebraic expressions   Put the steps to simplify in the correct order. Use only one algebra property or arithmetic operation in each step. It's possible you should not use all of the steps provided here as options.                                              Simplify the expressions using the commutative, associative, and distributive properties.           That first subtraction may be tricky. It may help to write that as addition of times the rest:             We start out with the distributive property and proceed from there:             We start out with the distributive property and proceed from there:              Why is the number called the multiplicative identity ?       Consider the expression . According to the order of operations, you should add this from left to right, and start out by adding .  Which property of algebra allows you to view this as equal to ? (Adding them that way is probably easier to do in your head.)       Whenever you combine like terms, which algebraic property of numbers are you using?        Vocabulary    Find the indicated inverse.      Additive inverse of        The additive inverse of a number is just the negative of that number. So the additive inverse of is           Additive inverse of        The additive inverse of a number is just the negative of that number.

  "body": " Comparison Symbols and Notation for Intervals   Here is a true fact: is larger than . That is a comparison between two specific numbers. We can also make comparisons using an unspecified number, like if we say that average rent for an apartment in Portland, OR is more than $1700. We are not saying what the average rent is, just that it's larger than $1700. In the first half of this section, we examine mathematical notation for making these kinds of comparisons.  In Oregon, only citizens and older can vote in statewide elections. That is saying something about a large group of citizens, not just those who are . It's saying that people who are and may vote; and people who are may not. So it's a statement about a large collection of numbers. In the second half of this section, we examine the mathematical notation for large collections of numbers like this.   Alternative Video Lesson      Comparison Symbols  In everyday language you can say something like is larger than . In mathematical writing, we have a shorthand notation for this: . It's used as follows: That short expression is read aloud as is greater than . The symbol is called the greater-than symbol.  Greater-than symbol        Use mathematical notation to write is greater than .    Use mathematical notation to write age is greater than .                 This is .    We can use the word age to represent age, and write Or we could use an abbreviation like for age, and write Or we could use as a generic variable, and write           At some point in history, it was settled that was a good symbol for is greater than . The tall side of the symbol is with the larger of the two numbers, and the small pointed side is with the smaller of the two numbers. One way to remember how this symbol works is to imagine it as an open mouth, and tell yourself that the mouth is hungry and it wants to eat the larger number.   We have to be careful when negative numbers are used in a comparison. Is greater or less than ? In one sense is larger, because if you owe someone dollars, that's more than owing them dollars. But the symbol does not work that way. This symbol tells you which number is farther to the right on a number line. With that understanding, is greater than .   How the symbol works.   a number line with marks at -8, -3, and 8; text indicates the numbers to the left are lesser numbers, and numbers to the right are greater numbers; text indicates that -3 > -8 and 8 > -3      Real numbers ordering    Use the symbol to arrange the following numbers in order from greatest to least.           We can order these numbers by placing these numbers on a number line.    And so we see the answer is            We can order these numbers by placing these numbers on a number line. Knowing or computing their decimals helps with this: and    And so we see the answer is         The greater-than symbol has a close relative: the greater-than-or-equal-to symbol  Greater-than-or-equal-to symbol  . It means just like it sounds; the left number is either greater than or equal to the right number. Consider these examples, five of which are true and one of which is false.   While it may seem unhelpful to write when you could write , the symbol is useful when at least one of the numbers in a comparison is not specific, like in these examples:   Sometimes you want to emphasize that one number is less than another number. For this, we have symbols that are reversed from and . The symbol is the less-than symbol and it's used like this: and read aloud as is less than . Less-than symbol    gives the complete list of all six comparison symbols. We've only discussed three of them so far in this section, but you already know the equals symbol. The other two are the less than or equal to symbol, , and the Less-than-or-equal-to symbol  not equal to symbol, . Not-equal-to symbol    Comparison Symbols  Inequality symbols  Symbol inequality    Symbol  Means  True  True  False     equals        is greater than        is greater than or equal to        is less than        is less than or equal to        is not equal to          Set-Builder and Interval Notation  If you write and have a particular voter in mind, what is that person's age? Maybe they are , but maybe they are older. It's helpful to use a variable to represent age (in years) and then to visualize the possibilities with a number line.   Graphs of inequalities    a number line, where the number 18 is marked; the portion of the number line to the right of 18 has a thick line overlaying it with an arrow pointing to the right; at 18, there is a left bracket character; text indicates the right area represents possibilities for age     The shaded portion of the number line in is a mathematical interval . That means a collection of certain numbers with a starting point and a ending point . The interval above doesn't really ever end, but we can say (infinity) is the ending point in this situation. So this interval starts at and ends at .  The number line in is a visual representation of a collection of certain numbers. We have notations we can use to write down such collections of numbers.   Set-Builder Notation  Set-builder notation   Set-builder notation attempts to say directly what condition needs to be met by numbers in the interval. We write set-builder notation like: and read it aloud as the set of all such that .    For example, is read aloud as the set of all such that is greater than or equal to . The breakdown is as follows.     the set of     all     such that     is greater than or equal to     The set of all positive numbers is , but the set of all non-negative numbers is .  The set of all possible Celsius temperatures for liquid water is .      For each interval expressed in the number lines, write the interval using set-builder notation.            Since all numbers less than or equal to are shaded, the set-builder notation is             Since all numbers less than to are shaded, the set-builder notation is             Since all numbers greater than or equal to are shaded, the set-builder notation is         Set-builder notation is useful, but there is an alternative for intervals that is less cumbersome.   Interval Notation  Interval notation   Interval notation describes an interval by saying where it starts and ends . It can look like any of these four options:     In , the interval starts at . Then it extends forever and has no end, so we use the symbol for where this interval ends . And we write . There is a subtlety about using the bracket on one side and the parenthesis on the other side. The bracket tells us that  is part of the interval and the parenthesis tells us that is not part of the interval.  Imagine if we wanted to describe all the numbers greater than , including numbers like but not including itself. Then we would write .  So there are four types of infinite intervals. Take note of the different uses of round parentheses and square brackets.   Types of infinite intervals in interval notation       An open-infinite interval means all numbers or greater, not including .   a number line with a mark at a; the portion of the number line from a to the right has a thick line overlaying it; there is a left parenthesis at a and an arrow on the right pointing right         A closed-infinite interval means all numbers or greater, including  .   a number line with a mark at a; the portion of the number line from a to the right has a thick line overlaying it; there is a left bracket at a and an arrow on the right pointing right         An infinite-open interval means all numbers or less, not including .   a number line with a mark at a; the portion of the number line from a to the left has a thick line overlaying it; there is a right parenthesis at a and an arrow on the left pointing left         A infinite-closed interval means all numbers or less, including  .   a number line with a mark at a; the portion of the number line from a to the left has a thick line overlaying it; there is a right bracket at a and an arrow on the left pointing left        Interval Notation from Number Lines    For each interval expressed in the number lines, write the interval notation.            The shaded interval starts at and ends at (including ) so the interval notation is             The shaded interval starts at and ends at (excluding ) so the interval notation is             The shaded interval starts at (including ) and ends at so the interval notation is          Alternative Convention for Sketching Intervals  When graphing an interval, there is an alternative convention than you might see in other resources explaining algebra. This other convention uses open circles and filled-in circles. An open circle is used in place of a parenthesis, and a filled-in circle is used in place of a bracket, as in this example for the interval .   a number line with marks at a and b; the portion of the number line between a and b has a thick line overlaying it; there is a hollow dot at a and solid dot at b         How many inequality symbols are there?       What is the difference between the interval and the interval ?       The expression is an example of notation.

Alternative Video Lesson      Equations, Inequalities, and Solutions  An equation is two algebraic expressions with an equal sign ( ) between Equation(s) them. The expression on either side can be relatively simple or more complicated:   A simple equation:   A more complicated equation:    An inequality is similar to an equation, but the sign is one of the five Inequalities inequality symbols ( , , , , and ). Inequality symbols  Symbol inequality  Linear inequalities in one variable    A simple inequality:   A more complicated inequality:    Equations (and inequalities) arise naturally from real-world math problems.   A parking meter needs $2.50 for one hour. You already fed the meter some quarters, nickels, and dimes, and it says that you've inserted $1.85 so far. How much more do you need to pay? Never mind if you already know the answer to that question. There is an equation hidden in this story, and we will write it down.  Since the question asks How much more do you need to pay? , let's use the variable to represent that amount. We've already paid $1.85, so that amount plus should be all that we need, which is $2.50. So the equation in this story is: Don't worry yet about what must equal. For now the important thing is to be able to write down that equation.    An equilateral triangle is a triangle where all three sides are equal. When an equilateral triangle has side length , it's altitude is .   an equilateral triangle with side length s; the distance from one corner to the middle of the opposite side is sqrt(3)\/2 s    Suppose the altitude needs to be at least units tall. What inequality does that give us?  The altitude is long, and at least means the inequality symbol . So we have Do not worry about what might equal. For now, the important task to be comfortable with is writing down the inequality.   The simplest equations and inequalities have only numbers and no variables. When this happens, the equation is either true or false . The following equations and inequalities are true : The following equations and inequalities are false :    With the equation in Example , if we substitute in for , the resulting equation is true. If we substitute any other number in for , the resulting equation is false. This shows us what it means to be a solution to an equation.   Solution  Equation(s) solution of  Solution(s) of equations  Inequalities solutions of  Solution(s) of an inequality   When an equation (or inequality) has one variable, a solution is any number that you could substitute for the variable that would result in a true equation (or inequality).    A solution to an equation (or inequality) is said to satisfy the equation (or Satisfy an equation inequality). For example, satisfies the equation . Satisfy an inequality    A Solution  Consider the equation . If we substitute in for and then simplify: we get a true equation. So we say that is a solution to . Notice that we used a question mark at first because we are unsure if the equation is true or false until the end. When it was clear we had a true equation, we certified this with a checkmark.   If replacing a variable with a value makes a false equation or inequality, that number is not a solution.   Not a Solution  Consider the inequality . If we substitute in for and then simplify: we get a false inequality. So we say that is not a solution to . Notice that we used a question mark again because at first, we are unsure if the inequality is true or false. Once it was clearly false, we made a little note ( no ) to acknowledge that we know this is false.      Checking Possible Solutions  Given an equation or an inequality, checking whether or not some number is a solution is just a matter of substituting that number in for the variable. Then with some arithmetic to simplify things, you determine if the equation\/inequality is true or false.   Is a solution to ?  To find out, substitute in for and see what happens. So yes, is a solution to .    Is a solution to ?  To find out, substitute in for and see what happens. So no, is not a solution to .  What about the inequality  ? Is a solution to that? Yes, because substituting in for would lead to , which is true.      Is a solution to the equation                               We have to substitute in for and simplify each side:   Since is false, is not a solution to this equation.           Is a solution to the inequality                               We have to substitute in for and simplify each side:   Since is true, is indeed a solution to this inequality.           Is a solution to the equation                               We have to substitute in for and simplify each side:   Since is true, is indeed a solution to this equation.          More Applications  Here are a few more examples like Examples where a real-world scenario leads to an equation. This time, we also try some potential solutions.   Cylinder Volume   The formula for a cylinder's volume is , where is the volume, is the base radius, and is the height. And is a number that is about . If we know the volume of a cylinder is  96\\pi  and if we also know its radius is  4  , then we can substitute these numbers in for and and we get an equation:    a right cylinder with radius labeled 4 cm; its volume is labeled as 96 pi cm^3       Is is possible that the cylinder is  4  high? In other words, is a solution to ? We will substitute in for to check: Since is false, is not a solution and the height cannot be  4  .      Is is possible that the cylinder is  6  high? We will try : When , the equation is true. This tells us that the height could be  6  .       Jaylen has budgeted a maximum of to repair some leaky pipes. The total cost of the repair can be modeled by , where is the initial cost and is the hourly labor charge after the first quarter hour. Since the total cost needs to be at most , it means we have the inequality . Is a solution? Does Jaylen have enough money to cover two hours of plumbing labor?  We will substitute in for to check: So we find that is indeed a solution to this inequality. In context, this means that Jaylen will stay within their budget if there are only hours of labor.     Linear Equations  A linear expression in one variable is an expression in the form , Linear expression where and are numbers, , and is a variable. For Expression linear example, and are linear expressions in one variable.  The following examples are a little harder to identify as linear expressions in one variable, but they are.    This is linear, with .     This is linear, with .     This is linear, with , and the two terms are written in reverse order.     This is linear because it simplifies to .      Linear Equation and Linear Inequality   A linear equation in one variable is any equation where one side is a linear Linear equations expression in that variable, and the other side is either a constant number, or is another Equation linear linear expression in that variable. A linear inequality in one variable is Linear equations in one variable defined similarly, just with an inequality symbol instead of an equal sign. Linear inequalities  Inequality linear  Linear inequalities in one variable     The following are each an example of a linear equation in one variable:  Note that is outside the square root symbol.  In a linear equation in one variable, the variable should not have an exponent other than or and the variable cannot be inside a root symbol (square root, cube root, etc.), a denominator, or absolute value bars.  The following are not linear equations in one variable:    There is no variable.     The exponent on is .     The variable is inside the square root.     The variable is in a denominator.     Linear equations (and inequalities) are special and these are the only kinds of equations (and inequalities) that are covered in the rest of . You don't need to know this for the exercises in this section, but a linear equation can only ever have exactly one solution, no solutions at all, or can be such that every number is a solution. For example, it is not possible for a linear equation to have exactly two solutions. There is a similar (but more complicated) story for linear inequalities. All of these details about linear equations (and inequalities) are covered later in .      Explain why the equation from Example is a linear equation.       Give your own example of an equation in one variable that is not a linear equation.       Do you believe it is possible for an equation to have more than one solution? Do you believe it is possible for an inequality to have more than one solution?

An elementary school classroom needs a minimum of square feet for the teacher plus a minimum of square feet per student. So if there are students, the total necessary area is square feet. If a classroom has square feet of area, then we have an inequality Could this classroom support students?                                      To kill bedbug eggs using heat, they must be exposed to at least for at least 90 minutes.

Never mind if you already know the answer to that question. There is an equation hidden in this story, and we will write it down.  Since the question asks How much more do you need to pay? , let's use the variable to represent that amount. We've already paid $1.85, so that amount plus should be all that we need, which is $2.50. So the equation in this story is: Don't worry yet about what must equal. For now the important thing is to be able to write down that equation.  "

In this section, we begin learning how to find solution(s) ourselves.   Alternative Video Lesson      Imagine Filling in the Blanks  Let's start with a simple situation so simple that you might not need algebra, but the example serves as a warm-up.   A number plus is . What is that number?  You may be so familiar with arithmetic that you know the answer already. The algebra approach is to translate A number plus is into an equation: where is the number we are trying to find. How do we find the value for that makes the equation true?  One valid option is to imagine what number you could put in place of that would result in a true equation.   Would work? No, that would mean , which is false.    Would work? No, that would mean , which is false.    Would work? Yes, because is a true equation.     So one solution to the equation is . No other numbers can be a solution, because when you add to something smaller than , the result is smaller than . And when you add to something larger than , the result is larger than .   This approach ( imagining what number works in the equation) might work for you to solve very basic equations. It's not going to work in general with more complicated equations. And so we move on to a more systematic approach that you can use all the time.    The Basic Principle of Algebra  Let's revisit , but think it through differently.   If a number plus is , what is the number?  If a number plus  equals , then the number is a little smaller than . We should be able to subtract  from to get that unknown number. (We are using the opposite operation from addition, which is subtraction.)   Add to mystery number to get , or subtract from to get mystery number    a number line marked at a mystery location with \"?\"; an arrow leaves \"?\" and arcs to the right, stopping at 6; above the arrow it says \"add 2\"     a number line marked at a mystery location with \"?\"; an arrow leaves \"?\" and arcs to the right, stopping at 6; above the arrow it says \"add 2\"      Doing that subtraction: .   Let's try this strategy with another example.   If a number minus  equals , what is that number? The mystery number must be a little larger than . The opposite of subtraction is addition, so if we add  to we will find the unknown number. So the unknown number is .   Does this strategy work with multiplication and division?   If a number multiplied by makes , what is that number? The mystery number is small, since it gets multiplied by to make . If we divide  by , we will find the unknown number. Note that division is the opposite action of multiplication.   Multiply mystery number by to get , or divide by to get mystery number    a number line marked at a mystery location with \"?\"; an arrow leaves \"?\" and arcs to the right, stopping at 6; above the arrow it says \"multiply by 2\"     a number line marked at a mystery location with \"?\"; an arrow leaves \"?\" and arcs to the right, stopping at 6; above the arrow it says \"divide by 2\"      So the unknown number is .    If a number divided by equals , what is the number? We must be starting with a larger number, since cutting it in half makes . If we multiply  by (because multiplying is the opposite of dividing) then we find the unknown number is .   These examples explore an important principle for solving an equation applying an opposite arithmetic operation. We can revisit and apply this strategy with more care and intentionality. If a number plus is , what is the number? We will use to represent the unknown number. The question translates into the math equation . Picture the equal sign as the middle of a balanced scale. The left side has a brick labeled lb together with one-pound bricks. So the total weight on the left is . The right side has one-pound bricks. (left side) shows the scale.   Abbreviation for pound  Why is lb the abbreviation for pound ? It has a connection to a balance scale (⚖), which is the symbol for the Zodiac sign L i b ra.    Balance scale representing , and the solution after taking away from each side    a balance scale; its left arm has one brick marked x lb and two bricks marked 1 lb; its right arm has six bricks marked 1 lb; the scale is in a state of balance     a balance scale; its left arm has one brick marked x lb and two bricks marked 1 lb; its right arm has six bricks marked 1 lb; the scale is in a state of balance; two of the 1 lb bricks on each side are being removed     a balance scale; its left arm has a brick marked x lb; its right arm has four bricks marked 1 lb; the scale is in a state of balance      To find the weight of the unknown brick, we can take away one-pound bricks from each side of the scale and that will keep the scale balanced. (right side) shows the solution.  An equation is like a balanced scale: the two sides of the equation are equal, and the two sides of the balanced scale have equal weight. Just like we can take away lb from each side of a balanced scale, we can subtract from each side of an equation. Instead of drawing two pictures of balance scales, we can use algebra symbols and solve the equation in the following way:   Each line of the algebra above shows what is called an equivalent equation . Equation(s) equivalent Each of those equations is algebraically equivalent to the one that came before it, Equivalent equations meaning it has exactly the same solution(s). The final equivalent equation tells us directly that the solution to the equation is .  In theory, there could have been more than one solution to the equation (although that is not the case with this equation). So conceptually, there is a collection of solutions to any given equation. We call this collection a solution set . Equation(s) solution set of Any set of numbers that only has one or a few numbers in it Solution set of equation is written using curly braces. In this case, the solution set is . Using braces to surround a collection of numbers listed out is called set notation , not to be confused with set-builder notation from Set notation  .   We have learned we can add or subtract the same number on each side of the equal sign, just like we can add or remove the same amount of weight on a balanced scale. Can we multiply and divide the same number on each side of the equal sign? Let's look at again: If a number times is , what is the number? Another balance scale can help visualize this.   Balance scale representing , and the solution after taking away half from each side    a balance scale; its left arm has two bricks marked x lb; its right arm has six bricks marked 1 lb; the scale is in a state of balance     a balance scale; its left arm has two bricks marked x lb; its right arm has six bricks marked 1 lb; the scale is in a state of balance; half the bricks on each side are being removed     a balance scale; its left arm has a brick marked x lb; its right arm has three bricks marked 1 lb; the scale is in a state of balance      At first, the scale is balanced. If we cut the weight in half on both sides, it should still be balanced. We can see from the scale that is correct.  Removing half of the weight from each side of the scale is like dividing both sides of an equation by : The equivalent equation in this example is , which tells us that the solution to the equation is and the solution set is .   Note that when we divide each side of an equation by a number, we use a fraction bar, not a division symbol. The equation could be written as , but algebra tends to avoid using the symbol. In part, this is because when writing by hand, it might be confused with a subtraction sign.   Similarly, we can multiply each side of an equation by if that is helpful, and it will keep a scale in balance. We can summarize these properties.   Properties of Equivalent Equations  Addition property of equality  Equation(s) addition property of equality for solving  Subtraction property of equality  Multiplication property of equality  Equation(s) multiplication property of equality for solving  Division property of equality   If there is an equation , we can do the following to obtain an equivalent equation.     (add the same number to each side)   (subtract the same number from each side)     (multiply each side of the equation by the same nonzero number)   (divide each side of the equation by the same nonzero number)        Solving One-Step Equations and Stating Solution Sets  Linear equations solving  Notice when we solved equations in , the final equation looked like , where the variable stands alone on one side of the equal sign. The goal of solving any equation is to isolate the variable in this same manner. Solving an equation   Putting together both strategies (applying the opposite operation and balancing equations like a scale) that we just explored, we summarize how to solve a one-step linear equation.   Steps to Solving Simple (One-Step) Linear Equations      Apply  Apply the opposite operation to both sides of the equation. If a number was added to the variable, subtract that number, and vice versa. If the variable was multiplied by a number, divide by that number, and vice versa.    Check  Check the solution. This means verify that what you think is the solution actually solves the equation. It's only human to have made a simple arithmetic mistake, and by checking you will protect yourself from this. Also there are situations where doing all of the algebra correctly will tell you which numbers are possible solutions, but even though your steps have no errors, those numbers might still not actually solve the original equation. Checking solutions will catch these situations.    Summarize  State the solution set, or in the case of application problems, summarize the result using a complete sentence and appropriate units.       Let's look at a few examples.    Solve for in the equation .     To isolate , we need to remove from the left side. Since is being added to , we need to subtract  from each side of the equation.   We should check the solution. To do that, substitute in for in the original equation: The solution is checked, and the solution set is .        Solve the equation for        Our goal is to remove that from the left side. Since that negative number is being added to we could subtract  from both sides.   It is just as effective to add positive to each side.   We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation:   The solution is checked, and the solution set is           Solve the equation for        To isolate the variable we need to divide each side by (because is multiplied by ).   We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation:   The solution is checked, and the solution set is        Note that when solving the equation in we found , and did not bother to write it the other way round as . All that really matters is that we ended with a clear statement of the solution set, which was .    The formula for a circle's circumference is , where represents circumference, represents diameter, and is a constant with the value of .  If a circle's circumference is  12\\pi  , find the circle's diameter.   a circle with the diameter labeled d and the circumference labeled c       The circumference is given as feet, so we will substitute in the formula with , giving the equation . Now we will solve for :   We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation: This checks out, so the circle's diameter is  12  .        To convert a temperature in degrees Celsius to degrees Kelvin, there is a formula The surface temperature of Pluto is about Kelvin. What is the surface temperature of Pluto in degrees Celsius?        Since we know the Kelvin temperature is the formula becomes the equation   and we need to solve for With being added, we should subtract from each side.   We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation:   This checks out, so the surface temperature of Pluto is degrees Celsius.        Examples so far have solved an equation by undoing addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. There is one last arithmetic action that we will look into undoing: negation . Negation is when you apply the negative sign to a number. Negation property of equality Undoing negation is simple though: just negate again. For example, .    Solve the equation for .    Our variable is not yet isolated because of the negative sign in front. To attack that negative sign, we can negate each side: We removed the negative sign from by negating both sides, and we can see that the solution set is .  An alternative is to think of the original negative sign as multiplication by . In that case, dividing each side by will successfully isolate .   Another alternative is to recognize that multiplying on each side by will also cancel that unwanted negative sign.   It is recommended that you review these three approaches for undoing negation, settle on the method that you like, and use it consistently.  We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation: The solution is checked, and the solution set is .      Equations with Fractions  When an equation has fractions, solving it uses the same principles. Of course you may need to use fraction arithmetic. Also, you might make good use of the reciprocal of a fraction as described in .    Solve the equation for .     Since is added to , we will subtract from each side.   We should check the solution by substituting in for : The solution is checked, and the solution set is .        Solve the equation for        To remove the from the left side, we need to add  to each side of the equation.   We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation:   The solution is checked, and the solution set is        When the variable in an equation is multiplied by a fraction, you can use the reciprocal of that fraction to help solve the equation. The reciprocal of a fraction is the fraction you get Reciprocal from swapping the numerator and denominator. For example, the reciprocal of is .  A reciprocal is useful because when a fraction is multiplied by its reciprocal, the result is . For example, . This helps us remove a fraction when it is multiplied by the variable.    Solve the equation for .     Our variable is multiplied by the fraction . While we could divide on each side by , that leads to a messy four-level equation: . To avoid this, we can just multiply on each side by the reciprocal of .   We should check the solution by substituting in for : The solution is checked, and the solution set is .        Solve the equation for        Our variable is multiplied by the fraction This is a negative number, so we should multiply by something negative to undo that part. But also we should multiply by the reciprocal of which is All together, we should multiply each side by   We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation:   The solution is checked, and the solution set is        Sometimes the variable is in the numerator of a fraction, like in . This is actually the same as . Either way, is multiplied by and divided by . So this is another situation where the reciprocal of a fraction can help.    Solve the equation for .     We can multiply on each side by and that will isolate :   We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation: The solution is checked, and the solution set is .        Solve the equation for        The left side is effectively the same thing as so multiplying by will isolate   We should check the solution by substituting in for in the original equation:   The solution is checked, and the solution set is            If you imagine the equation as a balance scale with bricks on each side, how many bricks do you imagine are on the left side? How many types of brick do you imagine being on the left side?       What is the opposite operation of multiplying by a negative number?

To bridge the first floor to the second floor, contractors determined the rise of each stair should be the given number of inches. Write an equation that can be used to find the run of each step. Then solve that equation and report what the run should be.      The rise is inches.                     The rise is inches.                    Markup   In retail, the profit margin  of an item being sold is a number that explains what percentage of the item's shelf price is profit. For example if the profit margin is 15% or 0.15, it means that 15% of the shelf price is profit for the store. If the shelf price is what a customer pays to buy the item and the item has a wholesale price that the store pays to obtain the item, then these numbers are related by the formula .      Suppose the profit margin is and the wholesale price is Write an equation that could be used to find the shelf price. Then find the shelf price.             We start with the equation and substitute in what we know. The value for should be and the value for should be So we have the equation   Now to solve for divide on each side by   So the shelf price is $9.14.           Suppose the profit margin is and the wholesale price is Write an equation that could be used to find the shelf price. Then find the shelf price.             We start with the equation and substitute in what we know. The value for should be and the value for should be So we have the equation   Now to solve for divide on each side by   So the shelf price is $27.

And we can add and subtract polynomials even when there is more than one term (such as ) using like terms. In this section, we will learn how to multiply polynomials with more than one term.   Alternative Video Lesson     Revenue  Avery owns a local organic jam company that currently sells about jars a month at a price of per jar. Avery has found that for each time they would raise the price of a jar by cents, they will sell fewer jars of jam per month.  In general, this company's revenue can be calculated by multiplying the cost per jar by the total number of jars of jam sold. If we let represent the number of times the price was raised by cents, then the price will be .  At the same time, the number of jars the company sells will be the that they currently sell each month, minus times . This gives us the expression to represent how many jars the company will sell after raising the price times.  Combining these expressions, we can write a formula for the revenue model:   To simplify the expression , we'll need to multiply by . In this section, we learn how to do that.     Review of the Distributive Property  Polynomial multiplication relies on the , and may also rely on the properties of exponents . When we multiply a monomial with a binomial, we can distribute the monomial to each term in the binomial. For example,     A rectangle's length is meters longer than its width. Assume its width is meters. Use a simplified polynomial to model the rectangle's area in terms of as the only variable.     Since the rectangle's length is meters longer than its width, we can model its length as meters.     The rectangle's area would be: The rectangle's area can be modeled by square meters.   In the second line of work above, we recognize that is the same as . Whether the is written before or after the binomial, we are still able to distribute the to simplify the product.       A rectangle s length is feet shorter than its width. If we use to represent the rectangle s width, use a polynomial to represent the rectangle s area in expanded form.  square feet        The rectangle s width is feet. Since the rectangle s length is feet shorter than its width, its length is feet. A rectangle s area formula is:   After substitution, we have:   The rectangle s area is square feet.        The distributive property can be understood visually with a generic rectangle . generic rectangle    A Generic Rectangle Modeling   a rectangle with two regions; the region on the left indicates 2x*3x=6x^2; the region on the right indicates that 2x*4=8x; together they add up to 6x^2+8x     The big rectangle consists of two smaller rectangles. The big rectangle's area is , and the sum of those two smaller rectangles is . Since the sum of the areas of those two smaller rectangles is the same as the bigger rectangle's area, we have: Generic rectangles can be used to visualize multiplying polynomials.    Multiplying Binomials   Multiplying Binomials Using Distribution  Whether we're multiplying a monomial with a polynomial or two larger polynomials together, the first step is still based on the . We'll start with multiplying two binomials and then move on to examples with larger polynomials.  We know we can distribute the in to obtain . We can actually distribute anything across if it is multiplied. For example:   Keeping this in mind, we can multiply by distributing the across . Think of as the cat. To continue, distribure more:   To multiply a binomial by another binomial, we simply used distribution twice and then simplified the resulting terms. (Multiplying any two polynomials can be done using these same steps. We will return to that idea later in the section.)    Multiplying Binomials Using FOIL  Instead of using two applications of the distributive property, people often memorize a shortcut using the acronym FOIL . The letters refer to the pairs of terms from FOIL each binomial that end up multiplied together.  If we take a closer look at the example we just completed, , we can highlight how the FOIL process works. FOIL is the acronym for First, Outer, Inner, Last .    F:  The term comes from the product of first terms from each binomial.    O:  The term comes from the product of the outer terms from each binomial. This was in the front of the first binomial and in the back of the second binomial.    I:  The term comes from the product of the inner terms from each binomial. This was in the back of the first binomial and in the front of the second binomial.    L:  The constant term comes from the product of the last terms of each binomial.      Using FOIL Method to multiply   a diagram that shows how to multiply using FOIL; x*x + x*3 + 2*x + 6       Multiplying Binomials Using Generic Rectangles  We could approach this same example using the generic rectangle method. To use generic rectangles, we treat as the base of a rectangle, broken up into and . Similarly we treat as the height, broken up into and . Their product, , represents the large rectangle's area.   Setting up Generic Rectangles to Multiply   a two by two rectangle with the terms x and 2 above the columns and the terms x and 3 on the left side of the rows     The big rectangle consists of four smaller rectangles. We can find each small rectangle's area in the next diagram with the area formula for a rectangle: .   Using Generic Rectangles to Multiply   the previous generic rectangles with the areas computed; x*x=x^2, x*2=2x, 3*x=3x and 3*2=6     To finish finding this product, we add together the areas of the four smaller rectangles:    Notice that the areas of the four smaller rectangles are exactly the same as the four terms we obtained using distribution, which are also the same four terms that came from the FOIL method. The FOIL method and generic rectangles approach are just different ways to represent the distributing.    Multiply using distribution.    We first distribute the second binomial across . Then we'll distribute again, and simplify the terms that are left.       Multiply using FOIL .    First, Outer, Inner, Last: Either with arrows on paper or mentally in our heads, we'll pair up the terms from each factor and multiply those pairs together.       Multiply using generic rectangles.    We begin by drawing four rectangles and marking their bases and heights with terms in the given binomials:   Setting up Generic Rectangles to Multiply   a two by two rectangle with the terms 2x and -3y above the columns and the terms 4x and -5y on the left of the rows     Next, we calculate each inner rectangle's area by multiplying its base with its height:   Using Generic Rectangles to Multiply   the previous generic rectangles with the areas multiplied; 2x*4x=8x^2, 2x*-5y=-10xy, -3y*4x=-12xy and -3y*-5y=15y^2     Finally, we add up all the inner rectangle areas to find the product:       Multiply and simplify the formula for Avery's organic jam revenue, (in dollars), from . In that example and represents the number of times they raised the price by 25 cents.    To multiply this, we'll use FOIL : Now we have a formula for Avery's revenue based on how many times they raise the price. If we wanted to, we could study this formula more to find ways to maximize that revenue.      Tyrone is an artist and he sells each of his paintings for . Currently, he can sell paintings per year. So his annual revenue from selling paintings is . He plans to raise the price. However, for each $20 price increase, his customers will buy fewer paintings each year.  Assume Tyrone would raise the price of his paintings times, each time by $20. Use an expanded polynomial to represent his new revenue per year.    Currently, each painting costs $200. After raising the price times, each time by $20, each painting's new price would be dollars.  Currently, Tyrone sells paintings per year. After raising the price times, each time selling fewer paintings, he would end up selling paintings per year.  His annual revenue can be calculated by multiplying each painting's price by the number of paintings he would sell: After raising the price times, each time by $20, Tyrone's annual revenue from paintings would be dollars.      What would happen if we needed to multiply two binomials, but also there is a monomial out front? What is the result for ?    We recommend focusing first on the two binomials. We can multiply them using FOIL even though they are written last in the product. Now we can complete the multiplication just by distributing that .       Multiplying Polynomials Larger Than Binomials  To multiply polynomials that have more than two terms, we can use repeated distribution and monomial multiplication. Whether we are working with binomials, trinomials, or even larger polynomials, the process is fundamentally the same.   Multiply .  We can approach this product using either distribution or generic rectangles. We can't use the FOIL method because there will be more than four pieces.

Avery has found that for each time they would raise the price of a jar by cents, they will sell fewer jars of jam per month.  In general, this company's revenue can be calculated by multiplying the cost per jar by the total number of jars of jam sold. If we let represent the number of times the price was raised by cents, then the price will be .  At the same time, the number of jars the company sells will be the that they currently sell each month, minus times . This gives us the expression to represent how many jars the company will sell after raising the price times.  Combining these expressions, we can write a formula for the revenue model:   To simplify the expression , we'll need to multiply by . In this section, we learn how to do that.  "
