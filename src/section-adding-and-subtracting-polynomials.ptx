      A <term>polynomial</term> is a type of algebraic expression with certain features we will
      describe below.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A company's sales, <m>s</m> (in millions of dollars), can be modeled by <m>2.2t+5.8</m>,
            where <m>t</m> stands for the number of years since <m>2010</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            An object is launched upward from the top of a building and its height, <m>h</m> (in
            feet), can be modeled by <m>-16t^2+32t+300</m>, where <m>t</m> represents the amount of
            time (in seconds) since the launch.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The volume <m>V</m> (in cubic inches) of an open-top box with a square base can be
            calculated by <m>30s^2-\frac{1}{2}s^3</m>, where <m>s</m> stands for the length of the
            square base, and the box sides have to be cut from a certain square piece of metal.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the expressions above are polynomials. In this section, we will learn some basic
      vocabulary relating to polynomials and we'll then learn how to add and subtract polynomials.

    <title>Polynomial Vocabulary</title>

      We start this section with a flood of vocabulary associated with polynomials.

                                                                                                              <idx><h>polynomial</h><h>terms of</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>polynomial</term> is an expression with one or more
          <xref ref="definition-term" text="custom">terms</xref> added together. A term of a
          polynomial must either be a number or the product of a number and one or more variables
          raised to natural number powers.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Here are three polynomials: <m>x^2-5x+2</m>, <m>t^3-1</m>, and <m>7y</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The expression <m>3x^4y^3+7xy^2-12xy</m> is an example of a polynomial in more than
              one variable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The polynomial <m>x^2-5x+3</m> has three terms: <m>x^2</m>, <m>-5x</m>, and <m>3</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The polynomial <m> 3x^4+7xy^2-12xy</m> also has three terms.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The polynomial <m>t^3-1</m> has two terms.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      A polynomial will never have a variable raised to a negative power, raised to a fractional
      power, in an exponent, in the denominator of a fraction, or under a radical. The following
      terms could never be part of polynomial: <m>x^{-3}</m>, <m>x^{4/5}</m>, <m>3^x</m>,
      <m>\frac{2}{x}</m>, <m>5\sqrt{x}</m>.
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>coefficient</term> (aka numerical coefficient) of a term is the numerical factor
          of that term.
        </p>
      </statement>

        <p>
          The <term>leading term</term> of a polynomial is the term with the greatest degree
          (assuming there is no tie). The coefficient of a polynomial's leading term is called the
          polynomial's <term>leading coefficient</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <p>
        The degree of the polynomial <m>4x^2-5x+3</m> is <m>2</m> because the terms have degrees
        <m>2</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>0</m>, respectively, and <m>2</m> is the largest. Its leading
        term is <m>4x^2</m>, and its leading coefficient is <m>4</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      To help us see a polynomial's degree quickly, it helps to write the terms in order from
      highest to lowest degree. When a polynomial's terms are written in this order, we say it is
      written in <term>standard form</term>. For example, we would change <m>7-4x-x^2</m> to
      <m>-x^2-4x+7</m> since <m>-x^2</m> is the leading term. By agreeing to write polynomials in
      standard form, we can look at the first term to quickly determine both the polynomial's degree
      and leading coefficient.

      <title>Production Costs</title>
      <p>
        Bayani started a company that makes one-gallon ketchup jugs for industrial kitchens. The
        company's expenses only come from two things: supplies and labor. The cost of supplies,
        <m>S</m> (in thousands of dollars), can be modeled by <m>S=0.05x^2+2x+30</m>, where <m>x</m>
        is number of thousands of jugs of ketchup produced. The labor cost for his employees,
        <m>L</m> (in thousands of dollars), can be modeled by <m>0.1x^2+4x</m>, where <m>x</m> again
        represents the number of jugs they produce (in thousands of jugs). Find a model for the
        company's total production costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Bayani's company only has these two costs, we can find a model for the total
        production costs, <m>C</m> (in thousands of dollars), by adding the supply costs and the
        labor costs:
        <me>
          C=\left(0.05x^2+2x+30\right)+\left(0.1x^2+4x\right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish simplifying our total production cost model, we'll combine the like terms:
        <md>
          <mrow>C \amp= 0.05x^2+0.1x^2+2x+4x+30</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= 0.15x^2+6x+30</mrow>
        </md>
        This simplified model can now calculate Bayani's total production costs <m>C</m> (in
        thousands of dollars) when the company produces <m>x</m> thousand jugs of ketchup.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      The process of adding two or more polynomials involves recognizing and then combining the like
      terms.

      A very important difference between adding and subtracting polynomials is that when we

      Notice that our first step in simplifying the expression in

    <title>Evaluating Polynomial Expressions</title>

      Evaluating expressions was introduced in

    <example>
      <statement>

          in context.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We will replace <m>x</m> with <m>10</m>:

          The context was that <m>x</m> represents so many thousands of jugs of ketchup, and
          <m>C</m> represents the total cost, in thousands of dollars, to produce that many jugs. So
          in context, we can interpret this as it costs <m>\$105{,}000</m> to produce
          <m>10{,}000</m> jugs of ketchup.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <p>
      Recall that in <xref ref="subsection-evaluating-expressions-with-negative-numbers"/> and
      <xref ref="example-evaluating-expressions-with-negative-numbers"/> we discussed how
      <m>(-2)^2</m> and <m>-2^2</m> are not the same expressions. The first expression,
      <m>(-2)^2</m>, represents the number <m>-2</m> squared, and is <m>(-2)(-2)=4</m>. The second
      expression, <m>-2^2</m>, is the <em>opposite</em> of the number that you get after you square
      <m>2</m>, and is <m>-2^2=-(2\cdot 2) = -4</m>. So when substituting a negative number in for a
      variable, we recommend always using parentheses around that number.
