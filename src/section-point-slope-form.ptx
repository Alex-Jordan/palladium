  <title>Point-Slope Form</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-slope-intercept-form"/>, we learned that a linear equation can be
      written in slope-intercept form. This section covers an alternative that is often more useful
      depending on the application: <q>point-slope form</q>.

    <title>Point-Slope Motivation and Definition</title>
    <p>
      Since 1990, the population of the United States has been growing by about <m>2.865</m> million
      people per year. Also, back in 1990, the population was <m>253</m> million. Since the rate of
      growth has been roughly constant, a linear model is appropriate. Let's write an equation to
      model this.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider using
      <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref>, but we
      would need to know the <m>y</m>-intercept, and nothing in the background tells us that. We'd
      need to know the population of the United States back in the year 0, before there even was a
      United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could do some side work to calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept, but let's try something else
      instead. Here are some things we know:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The slope equation for a line in general is <m>m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The slope of our line is <m>m=2.865\,\frac{\text{million people}}{\text{year}}</m>, or
            <m>m=\frac{2.865\,\text{million people}}{1\,\text{year}}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            One point on the line is <m>(x_1,y_1)=(1990,253)</m>, because in <em>1990</em>, the
            population was <m>253</m> million.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we use the generic variables <m>(x,y)</m> to represent a point <em>somewhere</em> on this
      line, then the rate of change from <m>(1990,253)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m> must be <m>2.865</m>. So
      <me>
        \frac{y-253}{x-1990}=2.865
      </me>.
      There is good reason to isolate <m>y</m> in this equation, so we do that.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{y-253}{x-1990}\amp=2.865</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{y-253}{x-1990}\multiplyright{(x-1990)}\amp=2.865\multiplyright{(x-1990)}</mrow>
        <mrow>y-253\amp=2.865(x-1990)\amp\amp\text{(could distribute, but don't)}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)\addright{253}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a good place to pause. We have isolated <m>y</m>, and three <em>meaningful</em>
      numbers appear in the equation: the rate of growth, a certain year, and the population in that
      year. This is a specific example of <term>point-slope form</term>. Before we look deeper at
      point-slope form, let's continue reducing the line equation into slope-intercept form by
      distributing and combining like terms.
      <md>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)+253</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865x - 5701.35 + 253\amp\amp\text{(distributed the }2.865\text{)}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865x - 5448.35\amp\amp\text{combined like terms}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      One concern with
      <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref> is that it
      uses the <m>y</m>-intercept, which might have no meaning in the context of an application. For
      example, here we have found that the <m>y</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,-5448.35)</m>, but what
      practical use is that? It's nonsense to say that in the year 0, the population of the United
      States was <m>-5448.35</m> million. It doesn't make sense to have a negative population. It
      doesn't make sense to talk about the United States population before there even was a United
      States. And it doesn't make sense to use this model for years earlier than 1990 because the
      background information says clearly that the rate of change we have applies to years 1990 and
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all these reasons, we prefer to have the equation back when it was in the form:
      <me>
        y=2.865(x-1990)+253
      </me>
      and we purposely do not distribute the slope.
    </p>

            y=m\left(x-x_0\right)+y_0
          </men>
          and this equation is called the <term>point-slope form</term> of the line. It is called
          this because two important features are immediately visible from the numbers in the
          equation: the slope and one point on the line.

      There is a subtraction sign and an addition sign in
      <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="custom">point-slope form</xref>, and you may have
      trouble remembering which is which. But remember that that the line is supposed to pass
      through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. So substituting <m>x_0</m> in for <m>x</m> should leave <m>y</m>
      equal to <m>y_0</m>. And it does. For example, consider our example equation
      <m>y=2.865(x-1990)+253</m>. Here, <m>x_0</m> is <m>1990</m> and <m>y_0</m> is <m>253</m>. And:
      <md>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)+253\amp\amp\text{substitute }1990\text{ for }x\ldots</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(\substitute{1990}-1990)+253</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(0)+253</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=253\amp\amp\ldots\text{and }y\text{ works out to be }253</mrow>
      </md>
      The subtraction is exactly where it needs to be to wipe out <m>m(x-x_0)</m> and leave you with
      <m>y_0</m>. More generally:
      <me>
        \underset{\overset{\downarrow}{y_0}}{\strut y \strut}=m(\overset{\overset{x_0}{\downarrow}}{\strut x \strut}-x_0)+y_0
      </me>
    </p>

    <remark>
      <title>Alternative Point-Slope Form</title>
      <p>
        It is also common to define point-slope form as
        <men xml:id="equation-point-slope-form-variant">
          y-y_0=m\left(x-x_0\right)
        </men>
        by subtracting <m>y_0</m> from each side. If you learn about point-slope form from some
        other resource, you may come across this. We feel that the <m>y=m\left(x-x_0\right)+y_0</m>
        form will be more helpful with college algebra, statistics, and calculus.

      The first uses <m>(3,2)</m> as a point on the line, and the second uses <m>(2,-1)</m>. Are
      those two equations really equivalent? Let's distribute and simplify each of them to get

      different-looking equations that still represent the same line.

    <p>
      Point-slope form is preferable when we know a line's slope and a point on it, but we don't
      know the <m>y</m>-intercept. We recognize that distributing the slope and combining like terms
      can always be used to find the line's slope-intercept form.

        estimated that the company will go out of business once its customer base decreases to
        <m>1800</m>. If this trend continues, when will the company close?
      </p>
      <p>
        The given information tells us two points on the line: <m>(2021,2975)</m> and
        <m>(2024,2585)</m>. The
        <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref> will give us the
        slope. After labeling those two points as
        <m>(\overset{x_1}{2021},\overset{y_1}{2975})</m> and <m>(\overset{x_2}{2024},\overset{y_2}{2585})</m>,
        we have:
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=\frac{2585-2975}{2024-2021}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=\frac{-390}{3}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=-130</mrow>
        </md>
        And considering units, this means they are losing <m>130</m> customers per year.
      </p>
      <p>
        We <em>could</em> make an equation for this line using slope-intercept form, but then we
        would need to calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept, which would correspond to the number of
        customers in year <m>0</m>. We'd be working with numbers that have no real-world meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        For point-slope form, since we calculated the slope, we know at least this much:
        <me>
          y=-130(x-x_0)+y_0
        </me>.
        Now we can pick one of those two given points, say <m>(2021,2975)</m>, and get the equation
        <me>
          y=-130(x-2021)+2975
        </me>.
        Note that all three numbers in this equation have meaning in the context of the spa chain.
        The <m>-130</m> tells us how many customers are leaving per year, the <m>2021</m> represents
        a year, and the <m>2975</m> tells us the number of customers in that year.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're ready to answer the question about when the chain might go out of business. We need to
        substitute the given value of <m>1800</m> into the appropriate place in our equation. In
        order to substitute correctly, we must clearly understand what the variable <m>y</m>
        represents including its units, and what the variable <m>x</m> represents including its
        units. Write down those definitions first in any question you attempt to answer. It will
        save you time in the long run, and avoid frustration. Knowing the variable <m>y</m>
        represents the number of customers in a given year allows one to understand that <m>y</m>
        must be replaced with <m>1800</m> customers. Knowing the variable <m>x</m> represents a year
        allows one to understand that <m>x</m> will <em>not</em> be substituted, because we are
        trying to <em>solve</em> for what year something happens.
      </p>

      <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
        <p>
          After substituting <m>y</m> in the equation with <m>1800</m>, we will solve for
          <m>x</m>, and find the answer we seek.

            We need to calculate slope first. And for that, we need to identify two points on the

            take a second point somewhere, and <m>(75,72)</m> seems like a reasonable roughly
            accurate choice. The slope equation gives us that
            <me>
              m=\frac{72-50}{75-50}=\frac{22}{25}=0.88

          <p>
            Using <m>(50,50)</m> as the point, the point-slope equation would then be

            So the slope-intercept equation is <m><var name="$si"/></m>. Note that the
            slope-intercept equation has an unfriendly fraction, and the fact that this can happen
            is another reason to use the point-slope form whenever it is reasonable to do so.

    <title>Recognizing Point-Slope Form</title>
    <p>
      We can tell a lot about a linear equation now that we have learned both
      <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref> and
      <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="custom">point-slope form</xref>. For example, we
      can know that <m>y=4x+2</m> is in slope-intercept form because it looks like <m>y=mx+b</m>. It
      will graph as a line with slope <m>4</m> and vertical intercept <m>(0,2)</m>. Likewise, we
      know that the equation <m>y=-5(x-3)+2</m> is in point-slope form because it looks like
      <m>y=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m>. It will graph as a line that has slope <m>-5</m> and will pass through
      the point <m>(3,2)</m>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For the equations below, state whether they are in slope-intercept form or point-slope
          form. Then identify the slope of the line and at least one point that the line will pass
          through.

                To write <em>any</em> of the equations representing this line in point-slope form,
                we must first find the slope of the line and we can use the
                <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref> to do so. We
                will arbitrarily choose <m>(0,30)</m> and <m>(-5,42)</m> as the two points.
                Inputting these points into the slope formula yields:
                <md>
                  <mrow>m\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp=\frac{\substitute{42}-\substitute{30}}{\substitute{-5}-\substitute{0}}</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp=\frac{12}{-5}=-\frac{12}{5}</mrow>
                </md>
                So the slope of the line is <m>-\frac{12}{5}</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, we need to write an equation in point-slope form based on each point shown.
                Using the point <m>(0,30)</m>, we have:
                <me>
                  y=-\frac{12}{5}(x-0)+30
                </me>
                (This simplifies to <m>y=-\frac{12}{5}x+30</m>.)
              </p>
              <p>
                The next point is <m>(20,-18)</m>. Using this point, we can write an equation for
                this line as:
                <me>
                  y=-\frac{12}{5}(x-20)-18
                </me>
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, we can also use the point <m>(-5,42)</m> to write an equation for this
                line:
                <me>
                  y=-\frac{12}{5}(x-(-5))+42
                </me>
                which can also be written as:
                <me>
                  y=-\frac{12}{5}(x+5)+42
                </me>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As <m>(0,30)</m> is the vertical intercept, we can write the equation of this line
                in slope-intercept form as <m>y=-\frac{12}{5}x+30</m>. It's important to note that
                each of the equations that were written in point-slope form simplify to this, making
                all four equations equivalent.

              <p>
                First we must find this line's slope using the slope formula:
                <md>
                  <mrow>\amp\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp= \frac{<var name="$top"/>}{<var name="$bottom"/>}</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp= \frac{<var name="$top->reduce"/>}{<var name="$bottom->reduce"/>}</mrow>
                </md>
                So the slope is <m><var name="$m"/></m>. Using the point <m><var name="$p0"/></m>
                and point-slope form, an equation for the line is <m>y=<var name="$f"/></m>.
