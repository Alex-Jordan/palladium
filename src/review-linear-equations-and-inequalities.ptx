    <title>Solving Multistep Linear Equations</title>
    <p>
      There is a regular process to use for solving a linear equation.
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Simplify</title>
          <p>
            Simplify the expressions on each side of the equation by distributing and combining
            like terms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Separate</title>
          <p>
            Use addition or subtraction to separate the terms so that the variable terms are on
            one side of the equation and the constant terms are on the other side of the equation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Clear the Coefficient</title>
          <p>
            Use multiplication or division to eliminate the variable term's coefficient.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Check</title>
          <p>
            Check the solution in the original equation. Substitute values into the original
            equation and use the order of operations to simplify both sides. It's important to use
            the order of operations alone rather than properties like the distributive law.
            Otherwise you might repeat the same arithmetic errors you (might have) made while
            solving, and fail to catch an incorrect solution.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Summarize</title>
          <p>
            State the solution set. Or in the case of an application problem, summarize the result
            in a complete sentence using appropriate units.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
    </p>

    <p>
      Simplifying expressions, evaluating expressions, and solving equations are distinct algebra
      tasks.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            An expression like <m>10-3(x+2)</m> can be <term>simplified</term> to <m>-3x+4</m> (as
            in <xref ref="example-differentiate-simplify-expressions"/>). However we cannot
            <q>solve</q> an expression like this. It is incorrect to say you will <q>solve
            <m>10-3(x+2)</m></q>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            An expression like <m>10-3(x+2)</m> can be <term>evaluated</term>, but only once you
            have a number to use in place of the variable. This is what happens in
            <xref ref="example-differentiate-evaluate-expressions"/>, where <m>x=2</m>, and the
            expression evaluates to <m>-2</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            An equation connects two expressions with an equal sign. In
            <xref ref="example-differentiate-solve-equations"/>, <m>10-3(x+2)=x-16</m> has one
            expression on either side of equal sign. You can <term>solve</term> this equation,
            because it is an equation. You can also solve inequalities. You just cannot solve an
            expression like <m>10-3(x+2)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When we solve the equation <m>10-3(x+2)=x-16</m>, we are looking for a number which
            makes those two expressions evaluate to the same value. In
            <xref ref="example-differentiate-solve-equations"/>, we found the solution was <m>5</m>.
            That number <m>5</m> makes both <m>10-3(x+2)</m> and <m>x-16</m> evaluate to the same
            number (and that number is <m>-11</m> if you were curious.)

    <title>Solving Multistep Linear Inequalities</title>
    <p>
      Solving a linear inequality is much like solving a linear equation. Two noteworthy differences
      are that multiplication/division by a negative number requires reversing the direction of the
      inequality symbol, and checking a solution takes more effort.
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Simplify</title>
          <p>
            Simplify the expressions on each side of the inequality by distributing and combining
            like terms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Separate</title>
          <p>
            Use addition or subtraction to separate the terms so that the variable terms are on
            one side of the inequality and the constant terms are on the other side of the
            inequality.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Clear the Coefficient</title>
          <p>
            Use multiplication or division to eliminate the variable term's coefficient. <alert>If
            you multiply or divide each side by a negative number, switch the direction of the
            inequality symbol.</alert>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Check</title>
          <p>
            A solution to a linear inequality has a <q>boundary number</q>. Using the original
            inequality, check (1) a number less than the boundary number, (2) the boundary number
            itself, and (3) a number greater than the boundary number to confirm what should and
            shouldn't be solutions are all working as expected. (This can take time, so use your
            judgment about when you might get away with skipping this checking.)

    <title>Linear Equations and Inequalities with Fractions</title>
    <p>
      For both equations and inequalities, it is often helpful to <q>clear denominators</q> if there
      are any fractions present. This is done by identifying the <q>least common denominator</q>
      for the fractions that are present, and multiplying on each side by that number. This lets you
      avoid some fraction arithmetic that could lead to human error.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <term>proportional equation</term> uses two ratios that should be equal to each other, for
      situations where two quantities change together. One example might use a ratio of how much
      of a substance is dissolved in how much of a certain liquid. Typically one ratio has two known
      numbers, and the other ratio has one known number and one unknown variable.

    <title>Special Solution Sets</title>
    <p>
      An equation or inequality might reduce to an unambiguously true statement like <m>2=2</m> or
      <m>4\lt9</m>. If it does, then the solution set is all real numbers. This can be written as
      <m>(\infty,\infty)</m> or <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another special thing that can happen is that an equation or inequality can reduce to an
      unambiguously false statement like <m>2=5</m> or <m>4\geq9</m>. When this happens, then there
      is no solution at all. We can say that the solution set is <q>empty</q>. The solution set can
      be written as <m>\{\}</m> or <m>\emptyset</m>.

    <title>Isolating a Linear Variable</title>
    <p>
      Equations might relate two or more variables to each other. When you have an equation like
      that (for example <m>2x+3y=4z</m>) you can solve for any one of the variables, isolating it on
      one side of an equal sign. The example could be solved for <m>y</m>, which gives
      <m>y=\frac{4z-2x}{3}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process for doing this is not different than solving a one-variable equation. You should
      just keep clear which variable you are solving for.

                The circumference of a circle can be found with the equation <m>c=2\pi r</m>, where
                <m>r</m> is the radius, or with the equation <m>c=\pi d</m>, where <m>d</m> is the
