  <title>Solving Multistep Linear Inequalities</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We solved inequalities in <xref ref="section-solving-one-step-equations"/> where only one step
      was needed to isolate the variable. Now we will work with inequalities that need more than one
      step.

    <title>Solving Multistep Inequalities</title>
    <p>
      When solving a linear inequality, we almost follow the exact same steps as we do in
      <xref ref="algorithm-solve-multistep-linear-equation">Process</xref>. One difference is that
      when we multiply or divide by a negative number on both sides of an inequality, the direction
      of the inequality symbol must switch. The other difference is that checking a solution set
      takes more effort.

            <title>Simplify</title>
            <p>
              Simplify the expressions on each side of the inequality by distributing and combining
              like terms.

          <li>
            <title>Separate</title>
            <p>
              Use addition or subtraction to separate the terms so that the variable terms are on
              one side of the inequality and the constant terms are on the other side of the
              inequality.

            <p>
              Use multiplication or division to eliminate the variable term's coefficient. <alert>If
              you multiply or divide each side by a negative number, switch the direction of the

            <p>
              A solution to a linear inequality has a <q>boundary number</q>. Using the original
              inequality, check (1) a number less than the boundary number, (2) the boundary number
              itself, and (3) a number greater than the boundary number to confirm what should and
              shouldn't be solutions are all working as expected. (This can take time, so use your
              judgment about when you might get away with skipping this checking.)

              in a complete sentence using appropriate units.

          Note that when we divided both sides of the inequality by <m>-3</m>, we had to switch the
          direction of the inequality symbol. At this point we think that the solution set in

          notation is <m>(-\infty,-2]</m>.

          Since there are infinitely many solutions, it's impossible to literally check them all. We
          believe that all values of <m>t</m> for which <m>t\leq-2</m> are solutions. We check that
          one number less than <m>-2</m> (any number, your choice) satisfies the inequality.
          <em>And</em> that <m>-2</m> satisfies the inequality. <em>And</em> that one number greater
          than <m>-2</m> (any number, your choice) does <em>not</em> satisfy the inequality. We
          choose to check the values <m>-10</m>, <m>-2</m>, and <m>0</m>.

          So both <m>-10</m> and <m>-2</m> are solutions as expected, while <m>0</m> is not. This is
          evidence that our solution set is correct. Making these checks would help us catch an
          error if we had made one. While it certainly does take time and space to make three checks
          like this, it has its value.

          Note that we divided both sides of the inequality by <m>4</m> and since this is a positive
          number we did <em>not</em> need to switch the direction of the inequality symbol. At this

      <title>Rate Problem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          When an experiment started, the pressure inside a gas container was <m>4.2</m> atm (one
          atm is the standard pressure air at sea level). As the container was heated, the pressure
          increased by <m>0.7</m> atm per minute. The maximum pressure the container is rated to
          handle is <m>21.7</m> atm. Heating must be stopped once the pressure reaches <m>21.7</m>
          atm. Over what time interval was the container in a safe state (meaning the pressure was
          less than or equal to <m>21.7</m> atm)?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This is a situation where something had an initial value (the pressure starts at
          <m>4.2</m> atm) and then changed at a constant rate (it increased by <m>0.7</m> atm per
          minute). So we can use
          <xref ref="men-rate-model" text="custom">the rate model formula</xref>. Except we are not
          exactly interested in the pressure <em>equaling</em> the final value of <m>21.7</m> atm.
          Instead, we are asked about when the pressure was <em>less than or equal to</em>
          <m>21.7</m> atm. So we have the inequality:
          <md>
            <mrow>0.7t+4.2\amp\leq21.7</mrow>
            <mrow>0.7t+4.2\subtractright{4.2}\amp\leq21.7\subtractright{4.2}</mrow>
            <mrow>0.7t\amp\leq17.5</mrow>
            <mrow>\divideunder{0.7t}{0.7}\amp\leq\divideunder{17.5}{0.7}</mrow>
            <mrow>t\amp\leq25</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the container was safe as long as <m>t\leq25</m>. Assuming that the time
          <m>t</m> also must be greater than or equal to zero, this means <m>0\leq t\leq 25</m>. We
          can write this as the time interval as <m>[0,25]</m>. Thus the container was safe between
          <m>0</m> minutes and <m>25</m> minutes.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <example>
      <title>Percent Problem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The population of a certain country grew by <m>7\%</m> over the course of the past decade.
          One town in this country grew in population too, but not as fast as the country did
          overall. Its current population is <m>22{,}341</m>. What might its population have been
          ten years ago?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> be the town's population from ten years ago. If the town had grown by
          <m>7\%</m>, then it's population would be <m>x + 0.07x</m>. But since it actually grew
          less quickly than <m>7\%</m> per decade, <m>x + 0.07x</m> would work out to more than the
          town's current population of <m>22{,}341</m>. So we have the inequality:
          <md>
            <mrow>x + 0.07x\amp\gt22341</mrow>
            <mrow>1.07x\amp\gt22341</mrow>
            <mrow>\divideunder{1.07x}{1.07}\amp\gt\divideunder{22341}{1.07}</mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp\gt20879.4\ldots</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So the town's population from ten years ago was at least <m>20880</m>.

                The opposite action to multiplication is division. When we divide by a negative
                number, the inequality sign must change direction.

            <p>
              <var name="$p"/> is driving on the highway, and presently has <var name="$start"/> of
              gasoline in <var name="$p->their"/> tank. <var name="$p->Their"/> car, <em>under ideal
              conditions</em>, uses gas at a rate of <var name="$rate"/>. When the tank reaches only
              one gallon of gas, the low gas light will turn on and <var name="$p"/> will start
              looking for a gas station. How far will <var name="$p->they"/> drive before this
              happens?
            </p>
          </introduction>
          <task>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Write an inequality to represent this situation, using <m>x</m> to represent how
                many miles <var name="$p"/> might drive before the low gas light turns on.

              <p>
                This is a rate exercise, and we can use
                <me>
                  (\text{initial value}) \pm (\text{rate})\cdot\text{variable} \mathrel{?} (\text{final value})
                </me>
                The question mark in the above is not an equal sign, because we are trying to set
                up an inequality. The initial value for the gas in <var name="$p->their"/> tank is
                <m><var name="$b"/></m>, <var name="$p"/> is losing gas (so we will subtract, not
                add), the rate is <m><var name="$m"/></m>, and the gas amount we are interested in
                reaching is <m>1</m>. We do not know far <var name="$p"/> can drive until the gas
                gets that low, and we decide to use <m>x</m> to represent that distance. The rate of
                gas consumption we are using is only valid under ideal conditions. So the quantity
                <m><var name="$b"/> - <var name="$m"/> x</m> will be <em>greater</em> than or equal
                to the actual amount of gas left in the tank after driving <m>x</m> miles. And we
                want this to reach <m>1</m>. So the inequality we set up is:
                <me>
                  <var name="$relation"/>
                </me>
              </p>

                </md>
                So <var name="$p"/> can drive at most <m><var name="$sol"/></m> miles.

            <solution>
              <p>
                <var name="$p"/> can drive at most <m><var name="$sol"/></m> miles, so the right
                end of the interval notation for this interval will be <m><var name="$sol"/></m>,
                with a bracket. We know <var name="$p"/> has more than 1 gallon of gas when this all
                started, so <var name="$p->they"/> can drive at least some positive number of miles.
                So the interval notation, accounting for the context of this exercise, is
                <m><var name="$interval"/></m>.
