  <assemblage>
    <title>Adding and Subtracting Polynomials</title>
    <p>
      A <term>polynomial</term> is a mathematical expression involving one or more variables where
      terms are added together. Each term must either be a number or be in the form of a number
      (possibly <m>1</m>) multiplied by the variable(s) raised to whole number powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>coefficient</term> of a term is the numerical factor in that term.
    </p>
    <p>
      A term with no variable factor is called a <term>constant term</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a term only has one variable, its <term>degree</term> is the exponent on that variable.
      When a term has more than one variable, its degree is the sum of the exponents on the
      variables. A constant term has degree <m>0</m>. For a polynomial overall, its degree is the
      largest degree among the terms of that polynomial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>leading term</term> of a polynomial is the term with the greatest degree
      (assuming there is no tie). The coefficient of a polynomial's leading term is called the
      polynomial's <term>leading coefficient</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>standard form</term> of a polynomial is when the polynomial is written with the
      terms appearing in descending order.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are special words for polynomials that have one term (<term>monmial</term>), two terms
      (<term>binmial</term>), or three terms (<term>trinmial</term>). There are special words for
      describing a polynomial of degree <m>0</m> (<term>constant</term>), degree <m>1</m>
      (<term>linear</term>), degree <m>2</m> (<term>quadratic</term>), and degree <m>3</m>
      (<term>cubic</term>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Polynomials can be added or subtracted together by combining any like terms from the two
      polynomials. For example, with
      <m>\left(4x^2+\frac{2}{9}x-5\right)+\left(6x^2-\frac{1}{6}x-3\right)</m>, we can add the
      quadratic terms <m>4x^2</m> and <m>6x^2</m> to get <m>10x^2</m>. We can add the linear terms
      <m>\frac{2}{9}x</m> and <m>-\frac{1}{6}x</m> to get <m>\frac{1}{18}x</m>. And we can add the
      constant terms <m>-5</m> and <m>-3</m> to get <m>-8</m>. So the result is
      <m>10x^2+\frac{1}{18}x-8</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be careful when subtracting polynomials to <q>distribute</q> the subtraction over the terms
      from the second polynomial. For example
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp\left(4x^2+\frac{2}{9}x-5\right)-\left(6x^2-\frac{1}{6}x-3\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=4x^2+\frac{2}{9}x-5-6x^2+\frac{1}{6}x+3</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=-2x^2+\frac{7}{18}x-2</mrow>
      </md>
      Notice all the signs that changed in the second step.

    <title>Introduction to Exponent Properties</title>
    <p>
      In an expression like <m>2^3</m>, we call <m>2</m> the <term>base</term> and <m>3</m> the
      <term>exponent</term>. The whole thing (which works out to equal <m>8</m>) is called a

    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain properties of exponent expressions that can be used to simplify or
      otherwise rewrite those expressions. Let <m>x,</m> and <m>y</m> represent real numbers,
      variables, or algebraic expressions, and let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> represent positive
      integers. Then the following properties hold:

    <title>Dividing by a Monomial</title>
    <p>
      You can split a fraction up into multiple terms if there is a sum or difference in the
      numerator and a monomial in the denominator. Symbolically:
      <me>\frac{a+b}{c}=\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}</me>
      This works with subtraction in the numerator as well. And it naturally extends to when there
      are more than two terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we also added one more exponent property:
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Quotient of Powers Property</title>
          <p>
            <m>\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}</m> (when <m>m\gt n</m>)
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      That is, when you divide a power by a power, and they use the same base, then the result is
      a power using the same base, with the difference of the exponents.

    <title>Multiplying Polynomials</title>
    <p>
      To multiply a monomial by a polynomial, you distribute the monomial to each term in the
      polynomial. For example:
    </p>
    <image width="40%">
      <latex-image>
        \begin{tikzpicture}
          \node[inner sep=0pt] (mono) {$\phantom{(}3x^2$};
          \node[anchor=west, inner sep=0pt] (leftparen) at (mono.east) {$($};
          \node[anchor=west, inner sep=0pt] (first) at (leftparen.east) {$5x$};
          \node[anchor=west, inner sep=0pt] (plus) at (first.east) {${}+{}$};
          \node[anchor=west, inner sep=0pt] (second) at (plus.east) {$4$};
          \node[anchor=west, inner sep=0pt] (rightparen) at (second.east) {$)$};          
          \node[anchor=west, inner sep=0pt] (result) at (rightparen.east) {${}=15x^3+12x^2$};          
          \draw [bend left=60,->] (mono.north) to (first.north);
          \draw [bend left=60,->] (mono.north) to (second.north west);
        \end{tikzpicture}
      </latex-image>
    </image>

    <p>
      To multiply a binomial by a binomial, you can use the <q>FOIL</q> acronym for <q>First</q>,
      <q>Outer</q>, <q>Inner</q>, <q>Last</q>. For each letter, pair up appropriate terms from the
      two monomials and multiply them together to get one term in the result. For example:

    <title>Special Cases of Multiplying Polynomials</title>
    <p>
      There are a few situations where you need to multiply two polynomials together and if you
      recognize certain patterns, you can almost immediately write the result instead of taking more
      time (and having more opportunities for human error).
    </p>
    <p>
      When two binomials are multiplied together where one is the sum of two terms and the other
      is the difference of the same two terms, the result is just the first term squared minus
      the second term squared.
      <me>(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2</me>
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
      <p>
        When a binomial is squared, the result can be written by taking these steps.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Square the first term.

          </li>

    <p>
      If a binomial is raised to a higher exponent than <m>2</m>, it may help to break the power
      into pieces that are raised to the second power and then multiply the results. For example
      when the exponent is <m>3</m>:
      <me>(a+b)^3=(a+b)(a+b)^2</me>
      We could square <m>(a+b)</m> and get <m>(a+b)\left(a^2+2ab+b^2\right)</m> and then multiply
      this trinomial and binomial together, no longer trying to use any special pattern recognition.

    <p>
      In addition to the four exponent properties already listed in this review, there are four more
      to be familar with. If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers, and <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are
      integers, then we have the following properties:
