  <title>Quantities in the Physical World</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In science, technology, and engineering you will work with numbers that represent measurable
      real-world quantities. Numbers that we measure are more often written as decimals than as
      precise fractions like we often see in algebra. There are some rules and conventions for using
      decimal expressions that we cover in this chapter. Also there are rules and conentions for
      working with <term>units</term> such as miles, seconds, gallons, etc. These are also
      covered here. And since 2D and 3D geometric shapes provide a source for real-world quantities,
      we include geometry applications here too.
