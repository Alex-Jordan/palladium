  <introduction>
    <p>
      We've seen that a linear relationship can be expressed with an equation in
      <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref> or with an
      equation in <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="custom">point-slope form</xref>. There
      is a third form that you can use to write line equations. It's known as <q>standard form</q>.

    <title>Standard Form Definition</title>
    <p>
      Imagine gathering donations to pay for a <m>\$10{,}000</m> medical procedure you cannot
      afford. Oversimplifying the mathematics a bit, suppose that there were only two types of
      donors in the world: those who will donate <m>\$20</m> and those who will donate <m>\$100</m>.
      How many of each, or what combination, do you need to reach the funding goal? That is, if
      <m>x</m> people donate <m>\$20</m> and <m>y</m> people donate <m>\$100</m>, what numbers could
      <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be to meet your goal? The donors of the first type have collectively
      donated <m>20x</m> dollars, and the donors of the second type have collectively donated
      <m>100y</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To reach <m>\$10{,}000</m>, altogether you'd need to have
      <me>
        20x+100y=10000
      </me>
      This is an example of a line equation in <term>standard form</term>.
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          It is always possible to write an equation for a line in the form
          <men xml:id="equation-standard-form">
            Ax+By=C
          </men>
          where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are three numbers (each of which might be <m>0</m>,
          although at least one of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be nonzero). This form of a line
          equation is called <term>standard form</term>. In the context of an application, the
          meaning of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> depends on that context. This equation is
          called <q>standard</q> form perhaps because <em>any</em> line can be written this way,
          even vertical lines, which do not have slope and therefore cannot be written using
          slope-intercept or point-slope form.

    <p>
      Returning to the example with donations for the medical procedure, let's examine the equation
      <me>
        20x+100y=10000
      </me>.
      What units are attached to each part of this equation? The <m>10000</m> is in dollars. Both
      <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are numbers of people. Both the <m>20</m> and the <m>100</m> are in
      dollars per person. So the terms <m>20x</m> and <m>100y</m> are ultimately in dollars. Note
      how both sides of the equation are in dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the slope of the linear relationship? It's not immediately visible since <m>m</m> is
      not part of the standard form equation. But we can use algebra to isolate <m>y</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>20x+100y\amp=10000</mrow>
        <mrow>100y\amp=\highlight{-20x}+10000</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=\divideunder{-20x+10000}{100}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=\frac{-20x}{100}+\frac{10000}{100}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=-\frac{1}{5}x+100</mrow>
      </md>.
      And we see that the slope is <m>-\frac{1}{5}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What units are on that slope? As always, the units on slope are
      <m>\frac{y\text{-unit}}{x\text{-unit}}</m>. In this case that's
      <m>\frac{\text{person}}{\text{person}}</m>, which sounds a little weird, but this slope of
      <m>-\frac{1}{5}\frac{\text{person}}{\text{person}}</m> is saying that for every 5 extra
      <em>people</em> who donate <m>\$20</m>, you need <m>1</m> fewer <em>person</em> donating
      <m>\$100</m> to still reach your goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the <m>y</m>-intercept? Since we've already converted the equation into
      slope-intercept form, we can see that it is at <m>(0,100)</m>. This tells us that if <m>0</m>
      people donate <m>\$20</m>, then you will need <m>100</m> people donating <m>\$100</m> to meet
      the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does a graph for this line look like? We've already converted into slope-intercept form,
      and we could use that to make the graph. But when given a line in standard form, there is
      another approach that may be preferable. Returning to
      <me>
        20x+100y=10000
      </me>,
      let's calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept and the <m>x</m>-intercept from scratch. Recall that
      these are <em>points</em> where the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis and <m>x</m>-axis. To be on
      the <m>y</m>-axis means that <m>x=0</m>, and to be on the <m>x</m>-axis means that <m>y=0</m>.
      All these <q><m>0</m></q>s make the resulting algebra easy to finish:
      <md>
        <mrow>20x+100y\amp=10000\amp20x+100y\amp=10000</mrow>
        <mrow>20(\substitute{0})+100y\amp=10000\amp20x+100(\substitute{0})\amp=10000</mrow>
        <mrow>100y\amp=10000\amp20x\amp=10000</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=\divideunder{10000}{100}\amp x\amp=\divideunder{10000}{20}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=100\amp x\amp=500</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have a <m>y</m>-intercept at <m>(0,100)</m> and an <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>(500,0)</m>.
      If we plot these, we get to mark especially relevant points given the context, and then
      drawing a straight line between them gives us <xref ref="figure-medical-procedure"/>.

    <p>
      With a linear relationship (and other types of equations too), we are often interested in the
      <m>x</m>-intercept and <m>y</m>-intercept because they have special meaning in context. For
      example, in <xref ref="figure-medical-procedure"/>, the <m>x</m>-intercept implies that if
      <em>no one</em> donates <m>\$100</m>, you need <m>500</m> people to donate <m>\$20</m> to get
      us to <m>\$10{,}000</m>. And the <m>y</m>-intercept implies if <em>no one</em> donates
      <m>\$20</m>, you need <m>100</m> people to donate <m>\$100</m>. Let's look at another example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        James owns a restaurant that uses about <m>32</m> lb of flour every day. He just purchased
        <m>1200</m> lb of flour. Model the amount of flour that remains <m>x</m> days later with a
        linear equation, and interpret the meaning of its <m>x</m>-intercept and <m>y</m>-intercept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the rate of change is constant (<m>-32</m> lb every day), and we know the initial
        value, we can model the amount of flour at the restaurant with a
        <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref> equation:
        <me>
          y=-32x+1200
        </me>
        where <m>x</m> represents the number of days passed since the initial purchase, and <m>y</m>
        represents the amount of flour left (in lb).
      </p>
      <p>
        A line's <m>x</m>-intercept is on the <m>x</m>-axis, so its <m>y</m>-value must be <m>0</m>.          <idx><h>Intercepts</h><h>finding</h></idx>
        To find this line's <m>x</m>-intercept, we substitute <m>y</m> with <m>0</m>, and solve for
        <m>x</m>:
        <md>

        So the line's <m>x</m>-intercept is at <m>(37.5,0)</m>. In context this means the flour
        would last for <m>37.5</m> days.
      </p>
      <p>
        A line's <m>y</m>-intercept is on the <m>y</m>-axis, so its <m>x</m>-value must be <m>0</m>.
        This line equation is already in slope-intercept form, so we simply recognize that its
        <m>y</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,1200)</m>. In general though, we would substitute <m>x</m>
        with <m>0</m>, and we have:
        <md>
          <mrow>y\amp=-32x+1200</mrow>
          <mrow>y\amp=-32(\substitute{0})+1200</mrow>
          <mrow>y\amp=1200</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        So yes, the line's <m>y</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,1200)</m>. This means that when the flour
        was purchased, there was <m>1200</m> lb of it. In other words, the <m>y</m>-intercept tells
        us one of the original pieces of information: in the beginning, James purchased <m>1200</m>
        of flour.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important thing is that both intercepts have relevant meaning in the context of the
        example. One was the initial amount of flour, and the other was how long until we would run
        out of flour.

          A table like this might help you stay focused on searching for <em>two</em> points. As
          To find an <m>x</m>-intercept, <m>y</m> must be <m>0</m>. This is why we put <m>0</m> in
          the <m>y</m>-value cell of the <m>x</m>-intercept row. Similarly, a line's
          <m>y</m>-intercept has <m>x=0</m>, and we put <m>0</m> into the <m>x</m>-value cell of the
          <m>y</m>-intercept row.
        </p>
        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
          <p>
            Next, we calculate the line's <m>x</m>-intercept by substituting <m>y=0</m> into the
            equation
            <md>
              <mrow>2x-3y\amp=-6</mrow>

              <mrow>x\amp=-3</mrow>
            </md>
            So the line's <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>(-3,0)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, we substitute <m>x=0</m> into the equation to calculate the
            <m>y</m>-intercept:
            <md>
              <mrow>2x-3y\amp=-6</mrow>

              <mrow>y\amp=2</mrow>
            </md>
            So the line's <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,2)</m>.

            In the third line, we wrote <m>-2x-6</m> on the right side, instead of <m>-6-2x</m>. The
            only reason we did this is because we are headed to slope-intercept form, where the
            <m>x</m>-term is traditionally written first.

        </sidebyside>
        <p>
          Now we can see that the slope is <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is at
          <m>(0,2)</m>. With these things found, we can graph the line using slope triangles.

        <p>
          First, we will try
          (and fail)
          to graph this line using its <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying to find the <m>x</m>-intercept:
          <md>
            <mrow>2x-3y\amp=0</mrow>
            <mrow>2x-3(\substitute{0})\amp=0</mrow>
            <mrow>2x\amp=0</mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp=0</mrow>
          </md>
          So the line's <m>x</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,0)</m>, at the origin. Hmm, the origin is
          <em>also</em> on the <m>y</m>-axis<ellipsis /> So we've also found the <m>y</m>-intercept
          even though that was not the immediate goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since both intercepts are the same point, there is no way to use the intercepts alone to
          graph this line. So what can be done?

        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%" valign="top">

            One is to convert the line equation into slope-intercept form:

            So the line's slope is <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>, and we can graph the line using slope
            triangles and the intercept at <m>(0,0)</m>, as in <xref ref="figure-through-origin"/>.

                  We can plot this by finding the <m>x</m>-intercept, which is at
                  <m><var name="$xi"/></m>, and the <m>y</m>-intercept, which is at
                  <m><var name="$yi"/></m>. After plotting these, we can just connect the dots and
                  extend the line past them. It is highly recommended to do some quality control by
                  checking that a few more points on the line you've drawn actually satisfy the
                  equation.

                Let's put <m>Ax + By = C</m> into slope-intercept form. Then, the equation

                possible, we must maximize the fraction <m>\frac{A}{B}</m>. The possibilities
                are <m>\frac{<var name="$little"/>}{<var name="$medium"/>}</m>,
                <m>\frac{<var name="$little"/>}{<var name="$big"/>}</m>,

                and <m>\frac{<var name="$big"/>}{<var name="$medium"/>}</m>. The biggest of
                these is <m>\frac{<var name="$big"/>}{<var name="$little"/>}</m>. Thus, <m>A</m>
                must equal <var name="$big"/>, <m>B</m> must equal <var name="$little"/>, and
                <m>C</m> must equal <var name="$medium"/>.

            <solution>
              <p>
                To make the shallowest slope possible, we must minimize the fraction
                <m>\frac{A}{B}</m>. The smallest of the possible fractions is
                <m>\frac{<var name="$little"/>}{<var name="$big"/>}</m>. Thus, <m>A</m> must
