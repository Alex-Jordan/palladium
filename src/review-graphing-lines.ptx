    <title>Cartesian Coordinates</title>
    <p>
      The Cartesian coordinate system gives us a way to identify exactly where a point is on a
      two-dimensional plane.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, a special point called the <term>origin</term> is marked.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Then two <term>axes</term> are drawn. An axis is a straight line that extends forever.
            One axis is drawn horizontally through the origin, and is known as the <term>horizontal
            axis</term>, or as the <term><m>x</m>-axis</term>. The other axis is drawn vertically
            through the origin, and is known as the <term>vertical axis</term>, or the
            <term><m>y</m>-axis</term>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now the plane has been divided into four <term>quadrants</term>. The upper right
            quadrant is Quadrant I. Then moving counter-clockwise around the origin, the remaining
            quadrants are numbered II, III, and IV.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Each axis is given a <term>scale</term>. This means marking some numbers on each axis
            so we know distances. Numbers must be marked in a way such that a numerical distance of
            <m>1</m> (for example from <q>0</q> to <q>1</q>, or from <q>1</q> to <q>2</q>) always
            corresponds to the same physical distance on the plane. However, it is OK (and common)
            for the scale on the <m>x</m>-axis to be different from the scale on the <m>y</m>-axis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now each point on the plane can be identified with an ordered pair of numbers,
            <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. The number <m>x_0</m> tells you a place on the <m>x</m>-axis, and the
            number <m>y_0</m> tells you a place on the <m>y</m>-axis. If you move up/down from that
            place on the <m>x</m>-axis, while also moving right/left from that place on the
            <m>y</m>-axis, there is one point where the two paths cross. And this is the point
            labeled with <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. Here are some example points with their coordinates.

    <title>Graphing Equations</title>
    <p>
      When an equation has the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, for example <m>y=2x+1</m> or
      <m>x^2 + y^2 = 4</m>, the <term>graph</term> of that equation is the collection of all the
      points <m>(x,y)</m> that make the equation true. Typically when you plot all these points on
      the Cartesian plane, you end up with a line or curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given an equation in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, you might want to
      know if that point is on the graph of that equation. To determine this, you can substitute the
      <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values from the point into the equation and see if it boils down to a
      true or false equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you draw a graph, given an equation with <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>? There are many valid
      methods depending on the equation, but the most fundamental tool you can use is to just make
      up some <m>x</m>-values and then use the equation to solve for the corresponding
      <m>y</m>-values. Then you have so many points you can plot as dots. With enough of these, you
      hopefully see a pattern and can connect the dots in a smooth way.

    <title>Exploring Two-Variable Data and Rate of Change</title>
    <p>
      With a table of <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values, the <term>rate of change</term> from one row to
      the next is defined to be
      <me>
        \frac{\text{change in $y$}}{\text{change in $x$}}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
      </me>
      Sometimes the numerator <m>y_2-y_1</m> is naturally negative, and sometimes the denominator
      <m>x_2-x_1</m> is naturally negative, and we need to be careful with signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When given a table of <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values, it is helpful to look for patterns. Some
      patterns we look for include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is the <m>y</m>-value always a certain multiple of the <m>x</m>-value?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is the <m>y</m>-value always a certain number added to the <m>x</m>-value?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is the <m>y</m>-value always the <m>x</m>-value raised to a certain power?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When you move from one row to the next, is the rate of change always the same?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When you move from one row to the next, does the <m>x</m>-value always get a certain
            number added to it, and the <m>y</m>-value always gets multiplied by a certain (possibly
            different) number?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      If you see one of these patterns, you can write an equation with <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> that
      captures the pattern you found.

    <title>Slope</title>
    <p>
      When you take any two points on a straight (non-vertical) line, the rate of change is always

      Slope can be calculated using the same formula as for rate of change in general:

      where <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> can be <em>any</em> two points on the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A useful mantra for slope is <q>rise over run</q>, because graphically as you move from
      <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, the amount you <q>rise</q> by is <m>y_2-y_1</m>, and the
      amount you <q>run</q> by is <m>x_2-x_1</m>. However, it is recommended that you get in the
      habit of thinking about the <q>run</q> as coming logically first, and the <q>rise</q> being a
      consequence of the run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slope triangles can be drawn onto the graph of a line to illustrate a <q>run</q> and its
      corresponding <q>rise</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sign of a slope has meaning:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A positive slope means the line tends upward as you follow it from left to right.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A negative slope means the line tends downward as you follow it from left to right.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A slope of <m>0</m> means the line is horizontal.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Also the larger a slope is, the more steep the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an application setting, if some quantity is growing at a constant rate over time, that
      rate that it is growing is the slope of a line that you would have if you were to draw a graph
      where time is the horizontal axis, and that quantity is the vertical axis.

    <title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
      If a line equation is written in the form <m>y=mx+b</m> (where <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> are
      numbers, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are variables) then it is said to be in <term>slope-intercept
      form</term>. The number <m>m</m> is the slope of the line, and the point <m>(0,b)</m> is the
      <m>y</m>-intercept of the line. Slope-intercept form is useful because you can immediately
      see the slope and the <m>y</m>-intercept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphing a line equation that is in slope-intercept form can be done by first marking the
      <m>y</m>-intercept at <m>(0,b)</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis, and then using slope triangles based
      on the slope <m>m</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, you might need to write down a line's equation in slope-intercept form. If you
      have a way to determine the slope and the <m>y</m>-intercept, then all you need to do is
      write down <m>y=mx+b</m> with the appropriate values for <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>. For example if
      you have a graph of a line, you can see the value of <m>b</m> where the line crosses the
      <m>y</m>-axis. And you can use a slope triangle to determine the slope <m>m</m>. Then writing
      <m>y=mx+b</m> gives you an equation for the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>m=1</m>, <m>m=-1</m>, or <m>m=0</m>, you don't need to write <m>m</m>; you can just
      write <m>y=x+b</m>, <m>y=-x+b</m>, or <m>y=b</m>. And if <m>b=0</m>, you don't need to write
      <m>b</m>; you can just write <m>y=mx</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an application setting, if you know the constant rate at which something is growing over
      time, that is the slope <m>m</m>. And if you know the initial value that the quantity had when
      the time <m>t</m> was <m>0</m>, that is the value for <m>b</m>. And so <m>y=mt+b</m> models
      that quantity growing over time.

    <title>Point-Slope Form</title>
    <p>
      If you know the slope of a line is <m>m</m>, and you know one point that the line passes
      through is <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then one equation for that line is <m>y=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m>, and
      that is said to be in <term>point-slope form</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Point-slope form is valuable because it allows you to work with an equation for a line and
      not directly care where the <m>y</m>-intercept is. Instead, you can work with any other point
      on the line, <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. The <m>y</m>-intercept happens where <m>x</m> is <m>0</m>, and
      in context, that might be meaningless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students need to become used to the subtraction sign in front of <m>x_0</m> and the addition
      sign in front of <m>y_0</m>. The different signs can cause confusion. But note that if you
      substitute <m>x_0</m> in for <m>x</m>, then the entire block <m>m(x-x_0)</m> is zeroed out and
      you are left with only <m>y_0</m>. This might help you remember those signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually you should resist the temptation to convert a point-slope form line equation into
      slope-intercept form. One exception is when you want to find the line's <m>y</m>-intercept
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphing a line equation that is in point slope form is straightforward. First, identify the
      special point that is being used, <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, and mark that point. Then use slope
      triangles based on the slope <m>m</m> to extend the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an application setting, if you know the constant rate at which something is growing over
      time, that is the slope <m>m</m>. And if you know some piece of data about one point in time,
      that tells you a special point <m>(t_0,y_0)</m>. And so <m>y=m(t-t_0)+y_0</m> models that
      quantity growing over time.

    <title>Standard Form</title>
    <p>
      A line can be presented with an equation in the form <m>Ax+By=C</m>, and this is called
      <term>standard form</term>. In standard form, the <m>y</m> is not isolated. And <m>x</m> and
      <m>y</m> have symmetric roles on the left side of the equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standard form can be useful in an application context where neither the <m>x</m> quantity nor
      the <m>y</m> quantity come logically first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike slope-intercept and point-slope forms, there is no direct meaning to the numbers in a
      standard form equation. The <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> don't directly tell you anything
      about the line's graph. However:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The line's slope is <m>-\frac{A}{B}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The line's <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>\frac{C}{A}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The line's <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>\frac{C}{B}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      With a line equation in standard form, it is easy to find the <m>x</m>- and
      <m>y</m>-intercepts, even if you don't memorize the facts listed above. You can just
      substitute <m>y=0</m> when looking for the <m>x</m>-intercept, and substitute <m>x=0</m> when
      looking for the <m>y</m>-intercept. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, when trying to plot a line from an equation in standard form, it might be
      easiest to locate the intercepts and plot them. Then connect those points and extend to make
      a straight line.

      Horizontal lines have equations of the form <m>y=k</m> for some fixed number <m>k</m>. The

    </p>

      Two vertical lines are parallel. If neither line is vertical, the two lines are parallel if
