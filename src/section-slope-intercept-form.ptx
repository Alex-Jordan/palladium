  <title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we will explore the most common way to write the equation of a line. It's
      known as <q>slope-intercept form</q>.

    <title>Slope-Intercept Definition</title>
    <p>
      Recall <xref ref="example-yaras-savings"/>, where Yara started with <m>\$50</m> in her savings
      account, and from then on deposited <m>\$20</m> each week. In that example, we used <m>x</m>
      to represent how many weeks have passed. After <m>x</m> weeks, Yara has added <m>20x</m>
      dollars. Since she started with <m>\$50</m>, she now has
      <me>
        y=20x+50
      </me>.
      In this example, there is a constant rate of change of <m>20</m> dollars per week, so we call
      that the slope. We also saw in <xref ref="figure-yaras-savings"/> that plotting Yara's balance
      over time makes a straight-line graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      The graph of Yara's savings has some things in common with almost every straight-line graph.
      There is a slope, and there is a place where the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis.
      <xref ref="figure-generic-slope-intercept"/> illustrates this in the abstract.

    <p>
      We already have a symbol, <m>m</m>, for the slope of a line. That other feature, where the
      line crosses the <m>y</m>-intercept is of interest to us now. The 
      <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term> of a line is a <em>point</em> where the line crosses the                <idx><h sortby="y-intercept"><m>y</m>-intercept</h></idx>
      <m>y</m>-axis. Since it's on the <m>y</m>-axis, the <m>x</m>-coordinate of this point is                <idx><h>Intercept</h></idx>
      <m>0</m>. It is standard to call the point <m>(0,b)</m> the <m>y</m>-intercept, and call the
      number <m>b</m> the <q><m>y</m>-coordinate of the <m>y</m>-intercept</q>. It is almost
      inevitable that people will find this too wordy, and will call <m>b</m> the
      <m>y</m>-intercept. But technically, the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,b)</m>.

            The line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis at <m>(0,50)</m>, so the value of <m>b</m> is
            <m>50</m>. And the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,50)</m>.

      One way to write the equation for Yara's savings was
      <me>
        y=20x+50
      </me>
      where <m>m=20</m> and <m>b=50</m> are immediately visible in the equation. Now we generalize
      this.

          </tabular>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            In the first three equations, simply read the slope <m>m</m> according to
            slope-intercept form. The slopes are <m><var name="$m[0]"/></m>,
            <m><var name="$m[1]"/></m>, and <m><var name="$m[2]"/></m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fourth equation was written with the terms not in the slope-intercept form order.
            It could be written <m>y=-8x+13</m>, and then it is clear that its slope is <m>-8</m>.
            In any case, the slope is the coefficient of <m>x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fifth equation is also written with the terms not in the slope-intercept form order.
            Changing the order of the terms, it could be written <m>y=-\frac{2x}{3}+1</m>, but this
            still does not match the pattern of slope-intercept form. Considering how fraction
            multiplication works, <m>\frac{2x}{3}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{x}{1}=\frac{2}{3}x</m>.
            So we can write this equation as <m>y=-\frac{2}{3}x+1</m>, and we see the slope is
            <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last two equations could be written <m>y=2x+0</m> and <m>y=0x+3</m>, allowing us to
            read their slopes as <m>2</m> and <m>0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the <m>y</m>-intercepts, remember that we are expected to answer using an ordered
            pair <m>(0,b)</m>, not just a single number <m>b</m>. We can simply read that the first
            two <m>y</m>-intercepts are <m><var name="$yi[0]"/></m> and <m><var name="$yi[1]"/></m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third equation does not exactly match the slope-intercept form, until you view it as
            <m>y=\frac{3}{7}x+\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)</m>, and then you can see that its
            <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>\left(0,-\frac{2}{3}\right)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the fourth equation, after rewriting it as <m>y=-8x+13</m>, we can see that its
            <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,13)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We already explored rewriting the fifth equation as <m>y=-\frac{2}{3}x+1</m>, where we
            can see that its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,1)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last two equations could be written <m>y=2x+0</m> and <m>y=0x+3</m>, allowing us to
            read their <m>y</m>-intercepts as <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(0,3)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, we know that <m>y</m>-intercepts happen where <m>x=0</m>, and
            substituting <m>x=0</m> into each equation gives you the <m>y</m>-value of the
            <m>y</m>-intercept.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </webwork>
    </exercise>

    <remark>
      <p>
        The number <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-value when <m>x=0</m>. Therefore it is common to refer
        to <m>b</m> as the <term>initial value</term> or <term>starting value</term> of a linear
        relationship.

          To assess whether the relationship is linear, we have to recall from
          <xref ref="section-exploring-two-variable-data-and-rate-of-change"/> that we should
          examine rates of change between data points. Note that the changes in <m>y</m>-values are
          not consistent. However, the rates of change are calculated as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                When <m>x</m> increases by <m>2</m>, <m>y</m> increases by <m>6</m>. The first rate
                of change is <m>\frac{6}{2}=3</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                When <m>x</m> increases by <m>3</m>, <m>y</m> increases by <m>9</m>. The second rate
                of change is <m>\frac{9}{3}=3</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                When <m>x</m> increases by <m>4</m>, <m>y</m> increases by <m>12</m>. The third rate
                of change is <m>\frac{12}{4}=3</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

          Since the rates of change are all the same, <m>3</m>, the relationship is linear and the
          slope <m>m</m> is <m>3</m>. According to the table, when <m>x=0</m>, <m>y=-4</m>. So the

          <p>
            To assess whether the relationship is linear, we examine rates of change between data
            points.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The first rate of change is <m>\frac{-6}{3}=-2</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The second rate of change is <m>\frac{-4}{2}=-2</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The third rate of change is <m>\frac{-6}{3}=-2</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            Since the rates of change are all the same, <m>-2</m>, the relationship is linear and
            the slope <m>m</m> is <m>-2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we know that the slope-intercept equation is <m>y=-2x+b</m>, but what number is
            <m>b</m>? The table does not directly tell us what the initial <m>y</m>-value is. One
            approach is to use any point that we know the line passes through, and use algebra to
            solve for <m>b</m>. We know the line passes through <m>(3,-2)</m>, so
            <md>
              <mrow>y\amp=-2x+b</mrow>
              <mrow>\substitute{-2}\amp=-2(\substitute{3})+b</mrow>

              <mrow>4\amp=b</mrow>
            </md>
            So the equation is <m>y=-2x+4</m>.

      <p>
        With a simple equation like <m>y=2x+3</m>, we can see that this is a line whose slope is
        <m>2</m> and which has initial value <m>3</m>. So starting at <m>y=3</m> on the
        <m>y</m>-axis, each time we increase the <m>x</m>-value by <m>1</m>, the <m>y</m>-value
        increases by <m>2</m>. With these basic observations, we can quickly produce a table and/or
        a graph.

    <example>
      <p>
        The conversion formula for a Celsius temperature into Fahrenheit is
        <m>F=\frac{9}{5}C+32</m>. This appears to be in slope-intercept form, except that <m>x</m>
        and <m>y</m> are replaced with <m>C</m> and <m>F</m>. Suppose you are asked to graph this
        equation. How will you proceed? You <em>could</em> make a table of values as we did in
        <xref ref="example-simple-slope-itercept-graph"/> but that takes time and effort. Since the
        equation is in slope-intercept form, there is a <em>better</em> way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this equation is for converting a Celsius temperature to a Fahrenheit temperature, it
        makes sense to let <m>C</m> be the horizontal axis variable and <m>F</m> be the vertical
        axis variable. Note the slope is <m>\frac{9}{5}</m> and the vertical intercept (here, the
        <m>F</m>-intercept) is <m>(0,32)</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Set up the axes using an appropriate window and labels. Considering the freezing
              temperature of water (<m>0^{\circ}</m> Celsius or <m>32^{\circ}</m> Fahrenheit), and
              the boiling temperature of water (<m>100^{\circ}</m> Celsius or <m>212^{\circ}</m>
              Fahrenheit), it's reasonable to let <m>C</m> run through at least <m>0</m> to
              <m>100</m> and <m>F</m> run through at least <m>32</m> to <m>212</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Plot the <m>F</m>-intercept, which is at <m>(0,32)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Starting at the <m>F</m>-intercept, use slope triangles to reach the next point. Since
              our slope is <m>\frac{9}{5}</m>, that suggests a <q>run</q> of <m>5</m> and a
              <q>rise</q> of <m>9</m> might work. But as
              <xref ref="figure-slope-intercept-temperature"/> indicates, such slope triangles are
              too tiny. You can actually use any fraction equivalent to <m>\frac{9}{5}</m> to plot
              using the slope, as in <m>\frac{18}{10}</m>, <m>\frac{90}{50}</m>,
              <m>\frac{900}{50}</m>, or <m>\frac{45}{25}</m> which all reduce to <m>\frac{9}{5}</m>.
              Given the size of our graph, we will use <m>\frac{90}{50}</m> to plot points, where we
              will try a <q>run</q> of <m>50</m> and a <q>rise</q> of <m>90</m>.

              Connect your points with a straight line, use arrowheads, and label the equation.

    <title>Writing a Slope-Intercept Equation Given Two Points</title>
    <p>
      Any two points uniquely determine a line. Once you identify two points, there is a process to
      find the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line that connects them.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-find-slope-intercept-form-given-points">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the slope-intercept form of an equation for the line that passes through the points
          <m>(0,5)</m> and <m>(8,-5)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Our goal is to write <m>y=mx+b</m>, with specific numbers for <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>. The
          first step is to find the slope, <m>m</m>. To do this, recall the
          <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref> from
          <xref ref="section-slope"/>. It says that if a line passes through the points
          <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, then the slope is found by the formula
          <m>m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>. Applying this to our two points
          <m>(\overset{x_1}{0},\overset{y_1}{5})</m> and
          <m>(\overset{x_2}{8},\overset{y_2}{-5})</m>, we see that the slope is:
          <md>
            <mrow>m\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{\substitute{-5}-\substitute{5}}{\substitute{8}-\substitute{0}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{-10}{8}=-\frac{5}{4}</mrow>
          </md>
          We are trying to write <m>y=mx+b</m>. Since we already found the slope, we know that we
          want to write <m>y=-\frac{5}{4}x+b</m> but we need a specific number for <m>b</m>. We
          <em>happen</em> to know that one point on this line is <m>(0,5)</m>, which is on the
          <m>y</m>-axis because its <m>x</m>-value is <m>0</m>. So <m>(0,5)</m> is this line's
          <m>y</m>-intercept, and therefore <m>b=5</m>. So our equation is
          <m>y=-\frac{5}{4}x+5</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the slope-intercept form of an equation for the line that passes through the points
          <m>(3,-8)</m> and <m>(-6,1)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We first find the slope between our two points:
          <m>(\overset{x_1}{3},\overset{y_1}{-8})</m> and
          <m>(\overset{x_2}{-6},\overset{y_2}{1})</m>. Using the
          <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref> again, we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>m\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{\substitute{1}-\substitute{(-8)}}{\substitute{{-}6}-\substitute{3}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{9}{-9}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=-1</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have the slope, we can write <m>y=-1x+b</m>, or more simply: <m>y=-x+b</m>.
          Unlike in <xref ref="example-find-slope-intercept-form-given-points"/>, we are not given
          the value of <m>b</m> because neither of our two given points have an <m>x</m>-value of
          <m>0</m>. To find <m>b</m>, remember that we have two points that we already know should
          make the equation true! This means we can substitute <em>either</em> point into the
          equation (for the <m>x</m> and the <m>y</m>) and solve for <m>b</m>. Let's arbitrarily
          choose <m>(3,-8)</m> to substitute in.
          <md>
            <mrow>y\amp=-x+b</mrow>
            <mrow>\substitute{-8}\amp=-(\substitute{3})+b\amp\text{(Now solve for }b\text{.)}</mrow>
            <mrow>-8\amp=-3+b</mrow>
            <mrow>-8\addright{3}\amp=-3+b\addright{3}</mrow>
            <mrow>-5\amp=b</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude that the slope-intercept line equation is <m>y=-x-5</m>.

    <title>Modeling with Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
      We can model many relationships using slope-intercept form, and then solve related questions
      using algebra. Here are a few examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Uber is a ride-sharing company. Its pricing in Portland factors in how much time and how
          many miles a trip takes. But if you assume that rides average out at a speed of
          <quantity>
            <mag>30</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
          </quantity>,
          then their pricing scheme boils down to a base of <m>\$7.35</m> for the trip, plus
          <m>\$3.85</m> per mile. Use a slope-intercept equation and algebra to answer these
          questions.
          <ol marker="a.">
            <li>
              <p>
                How much is the fare if a trip is <m>5.3</m> miles long?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                With <m>\$100</m> available to you, how long of a trip can you afford?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The rate of change (slope) is <m>\$3.85</m> per mile, and the starting value is
          <m>\$7.35</m>. So the slope-intercept equation is
          <me>
            y=3.85x+7.35
          </me>.
          In this equation, <m>x</m> stands for the number of miles in a trip, and <m>y</m> stands
          for the amount of money to be charged.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a trip is <m>5.3</m> miles long, we substitute <m>x=5.3</m> into the equation and we
          have:
          <md>
            <mrow>y\amp=3.85x+7.35</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=3.85(\substitute{5.3})+7.35</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=20.405+7.35</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=27.755</mrow>
          </md>
          And the <m>5.3</m>-mile ride will cost you about <m>\$27.76</m>. (We say <q>about</q>,
          because this was all assuming you average
          <quantity>
            <mag>30</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
          </quantity>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, to find how long of a trip would cost <m>\$100</m>, we substitute <m>y=100</m> into
          the equation and solve for <m>x</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>y\amp=3.85x+7.35</mrow>
            <mrow>\substitute{100}\amp=3.85x+7.35</mrow>
            <mrow>100\subtractright{7.35}\amp=3.85x</mrow>
            <mrow>92.65\amp=3.85x</mrow>
            <mrow>\divideunder{92.65}{3.85}\amp=x</mrow>
            <mrow>24.06\amp\approx x</mrow>
          </md>
          So with <m>\$100</m> you could afford a little more than a <m>24</m>-mile trip.

            In a certain wildlife reservation in Africa, there are approximately <m>2400</m>

            Use a slope-intercept equation and algebra to answer these questions.

            </ol>

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The rate of change (slope) is <m>-30</m> elephants per year. Notice that since we are
            losing elephants, the slope is a negative number. The starting value is <m>2400</m>
            elephants. So the slope-intercept equation is
            <me>
              y=-30x+2400
            </me>.
            In this equation, <m>x</m> stands for a number of years into the future, and <m>y</m>
            stands for the elephant population. To estimate the elephant population <m>15</m> years
            later, we substitute <m>x</m> in the equation with <m>15</m>, and we have:
            <md>
              <mrow>y\amp=-30x+2400</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=-30(\substitute{15})+2400</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=-450+2400</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=1950</mrow>
            </md>
            So if the trend continues, there would be <m>1950</m> elephants on this reservation 15
            years later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, to find when the elephant population would decrease to <m>1200</m>, we substitute
            <m>y</m> in the equation with <m>1200</m>, and solve for <m>x</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow>y\amp=-30x+2400</mrow>
              <mrow>\substitute{1200}\amp=-30x+2400</mrow>
              <mrow>1200\subtractright{2400}\amp=-30x</mrow>
              <mrow>-1200\amp=-30x</mrow>
              <mrow>\divideunder{-1200}{-30}\amp=x</mrow>
              <mrow>40\amp=x</mrow>
            </md>
            So if the trend continues, <m>40</m> years later, the elephant population would dwindle
            to <m>1200</m>.
