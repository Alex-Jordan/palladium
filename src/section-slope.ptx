  <title>Slope</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-exploring-two-variable-data-and-rate-of-change">Section</xref>, we
      saw that a steady, constant rate of change between points means there is a linear
      relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. A steady, constant rate of change has a special
      name, <em>slope</em>, and we'll explore slope more in this section.

        <p>
          Given a graph with points plotted, when the rate of change from one point to the next one
          never changes, those points must all be on a straight line as in
          <xref ref="figure-constant-rate-of-change"/>. Instead of saying <q>steady, constant rate
          of change</q>, there is a special word for this.

          points is the same no matter which two points are used, we call this common rate of change

    <p>
      Considering the definition for
      <xref ref="definition-rate-of-change" text="custom">rate of change</xref>, this means that
      when <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are two variables where the rate of change between two points is
      always the same, then you can calculate slope, <m>m</m>, by finding two distinct data points
      <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, and calculating
      <men xml:id="equation-slope-definition">
        m=\frac{\text{change in $y$}}{\text{change in $x$}}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
      </men>.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <title>Slope <m>m</m></title>
      <p>
        Why is the letter <m>m</m> used as the symbol for <q>slope</q>? Some believe that it comes
        from the French word <q>monter</q> which means <q>to climb</q>.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      A slope is a rate of change. So if there are units for the horizontal and vertical variables,
      then there will be units for the slope. The slope will be measured in
      <m>\frac{\text{vertical units}}{\text{horizontal units}}</m>. If the slope is nonzero, we say           <idx><h>Linear relationship</h></idx>
      that there is a <term>linear relationship</term> between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. When the slope          <idx><h>Relationship</h><h>linear</h></idx>
      is <m>0</m>, we say that <m>y</m> is <term>constant</term> with respect to <m>x</m>.                    <idx><h>Relationship</h><h>constant</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some scenarios with different slopes. As you read each scenario, note how a slope is
      more meaningful with units.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a tree grows <m>2.5</m> feet every year, its rate of change in height is the same
            from year to year. So the height and time have a linear relationship where the slope is
            <quantity>
              <mag>2.5</mag><unit base="foot" /><per base="year" />
            </quantity>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If a company loses <m>2</m> million dollars every year, its rate of change in reserve
            funds is the same from year to year. So the company's reserve funds and time have a
            linear relationship where the slope is <m>-2</m> million dollars per year.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If Sakura is an adult who has stopped growing, her rate of change in height is the same
            from year to year<mdash/>it's zero. So the slope is
            <quantity>
              <mag>0</mag><unit base="inch" /><per base="year" />
            </quantity>.
            Sakura's height is constant with respect to time. Since the slope is zero, we don't say
            that Sakura's height and time have a linear relationship.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        A useful phrase for remembering the definition of slope is <q>rise over run</q>. Here,                <idx><h>Rise over run</h></idx>
        <q>rise</q> refers to <q>change in <m>y</m></q>, and <q>run</q> refers to <q>change in
        <m>x</m></q>. Be careful. As mentioned earlier, in mathematics the horizontal direction
        comes <em>first</em>. The phrase <q>rise over run</q> might make it sound like the vertical
        direction comes first, but that is misleading. (It's a bit awkward to say, but the phrase
        <q>run under rise</q> puts the horizontal change first.)
      </p>
    </remark>

    <example xml:id="example-yaras-savings">
      <title>Yara's Savings</title>
      <p>
        On Dec.<nbsp/>31, Yara had only <m>\$50</m> in her savings account. For the the new year,
        she resolved to deposit <m>\$20</m> into her savings account each week, without withdrawing
        any money from the account. Yara keeps her resolution, and her account balance increases
        steadily by <m>\$20</m> each week. That's a constant rate of change, so her account balance
        has a linear relationship with time, and the slope is
        <m>20\, \frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can model the balance, <m>y</m> (measured in dollars) in Yara's savings account <m>x</m>
        weeks after she started making deposits with an equation. Since Yara started with
        <m>\$50</m> and adds <m>\$20</m> each week, then <m>x</m> weeks after she started making
        deposits,
        <men xml:id="equation-yaras-savings">
          y = 50 + 20x
        </men>
        where <m>y</m> is a dollar amount. Notice that the slope,
        <m>20\,\frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>, is used as the multiplier for <m>x</m>, the
        number of weeks that have passed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can also examine Yara's savings using a table as in
        <xref ref="figure-yaras-savings-table"/>.

      </figure>

      <p>
        In first rows of the table, we see that when <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> (week), then
        <m>y</m> increases by <m>20</m> (dollars). The row-to-row rate of change is
        <m>\frac{20\,\text{dollars}}{1\,\text{wk}} = 20\,\frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>,
        which we already know is the slope. In any table showing a linear relationship, whenever
        <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> unit, <m>y</m> will increase by the slope.
      </p>

      <p>
        In later rows, notice that the change in <m>x</m> is larger than <m>1</m>, but the change in
        <m>y</m> is also larger than <m>20</m>. The changes in <m>y</m> have grown proportionally
        with the changes in <m>x</m> and this keeps the <em>rate</em> of change steady. Looking in
        particular at the last two rows of the table, we see <m>x</m> increases by <m>5</m> and
        <m>y</m> increases by <m>100</m>, which gives a rate of change
        <m>\frac{100\,\text{dollars}}{5\,\text{wk}} = 20\,\frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>,
        which is once again the value of the slope.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a graph of Yara's savings, we can <q>see</q> the rates of change between consecutive rows
        of the table by using <term>slope triangles</term>. These are right triangles showing how to          <idx><h>Slope</h><h>triangle</h></idx>
        move horizontally, then vertically, to get from one point to another.

            The large slope triangle indicates that when <m>5</m> weeks pass, Yara saves
            <m>\$100</m>. This is the rate of change between the last two rows of the table,
            <m>\frac{100}{5} = 20 \, \frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>. The smaller slope
            triangles indicate, from left to right, the rates of change
            <m>\frac{20\,\text{dollars}}{1\,\text{wk}}</m>, <m>\frac{20\,\text{dollars}}{1\,\text{wk}}</m>,
            <m>\frac{40\,\text{dollars}}{2\,\text{wk}}</m>, and
            <m>\frac{60\,\text{dollars}}{3\,\text{wk}}</m> respectively. All of these rates simplify
            to the slope, <m>20 \, \frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>.

      <p>
        Every slope triangle on the graph of Yara's savings has the same angles even though some are
        larger than others. Since the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change is always
        <m>20\, \frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>. On any graph of any sloped line, we can draw a
        slope triangle and compute slope as <q>rise over run</q>.

        <p>
          Of course, we could draw a slope triangle on the top side of a line. This slope triangle
          works just as well for identifying <q>rise</q> and <q>run</q>, but it emphasizes vertical
          change before horizontal change. For consistency with mathematical conventions, we will
          usually draw slope triangles that show the horizontal change first, followed by the vertical
          change, as in <xref ref="figure-yaras-savings"/>.

          To find a line's slope using its graph, we first identify two points on it and then draw a
          slope triangle. Naturally, we would want to choose two points whose <m>x</m>- and
          <m>y</m>-coordinates are easy to identify exactly based on the graph. We choose the two
          points where <m>x=3</m> and <m>x=6</m>, because they are right on grid line crossings:

            Notice that the <em>change</em> in <m>y</m> is negative, because the amount of gas is
            decreasing. Since we chose points with integer coordinates, we can easily calculate the
            slope:
            <me>
              \text{slope}=\frac{-2\,\text{gallons}}{3\,\text{hours}}=-\frac{2}{3}\,\frac{\text{gal}}{\text{h}}
            </me>.
            In the given context, this slope implies gas in the tank is <em>decreasing</em> at the
            rate of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>
            <quantity>
              <unit base="gallon" /><per base="hour" />
            </quantity>.
            Since this slope is written as a fraction, another way to understand it is that Kiran
            is using <m>2</m> gallons of gas every <m>3</m> hours.

            To find the slope of a line from its graph, we first need to identify two points that
            the line passes through. It is wise to choose points with integer coordinates. For this

      It's useful to understand when more than one line having different slopes appear on the same 
      coordinate system.

      <p>
        Effie, Ivan and Cleo are in a foot race. <xref ref="figure-foot-race"/> models the distance
        each has traveled in the first few seconds. Each runner takes a second to accelerate up to
        their running speed, but then runs at a constant speed. So they are then traveling with a
        constant rate of change, and the straight line portions of their graphs have a slope. Find
        each line's slope, and interpret its meaning in this context. What comparisons can you make
        with these runners?

        In a distance-over-time graph, the slope of a line represents speed. The slopes in these
        examples and the running speeds of these runners are measured in
        <quantity>
          <unit base="meter"/><per base="second"/>
        </quantity>.
        A relationship we can see is that the more steeply a line is slanted, the larger the slope
        is. This should make sense because for each passing second, the faster runner travels
        farther, making a slope triangle's height taller. This means that we can tell that Cleo is
        the fastest runner (and Effie is the slowest) just by comparing the slopes
        <m>4>3.5>2.666</m>.

    <title>Finding Slope by Two Given Points</title>
    <p>
      Several times in this section we computed a slope by drawing a slope triangle. That's not
      necessary if you already have coordinates for two points on a line. In fact, sometimes it's
      not practical to draw a slope triangle. (For instance if you only have specific information
      about two points that are too close together to draw a triangle, or if you cannot clearly see
      precise coordinates where you might start and stop your slope triangle.) Here we will show
      how to find a line's slope without drawing a slope triangle.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Your neighbor planted a sapling from a local nursery in his front yard several years ago.
        Ever since then, it has been growing at a constant rate. By the end of the third year, the
        tree was
        <quantity>
          <mag>15</mag><unit base="foot" />
        </quantity>
        tall. By the end of the sixth year, the tree was
        <quantity>
          <mag>27</mag><unit base="foot" />
        </quantity>
        tall. What's the tree's rate of growth (<ie/><nbsp/>the slope)?
      </p>

      <p>
        We <em>could</em> sketch a graph for this scenario, and include a slope triangle. If we did
        that, it would look like:

        <p>
          By the slope triangle and <xref ref="equation-slope-definition"/> we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{slope}=m\amp =\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{12\,\text{ft}}{3\,\text{yr}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =4\frac{\text{ft}}{\text{yr}}</mrow>
          </md>
          So the tree is growing at a rate of
          <quantity>
            <mag>4</mag><unit base="foot" /><per base="year" />
          </quantity>
        </p>
      </sidebyside>

      <p>
        But hold on. Did we really <em>need</em> this picture? The <q>rise</q> of <m>12</m> came
        from a subtraction of two <m>y</m>-values: <m>27-15</m>. And the <q>run</q> of <m>3</m> came
        from a subtraction of two <m>x</m>-values: <m>6-3</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a picture-free approach. We know that after
        <quantity>
          <mag>3</mag><unit base="year" />
        </quantity>, the height is
        <quantity>
          <mag>15</mag><unit base="foot" />
        </quantity>.
        As an ordered pair, that information gives us the point <m>(3,15)</m> which we can label as
        <m>(\overset{x_1}{3},\overset{y_1}{15})</m>. Similarly, the background information tells us
        to consider <m>(6,27)</m>, which we label as <m>(\overset{x_2}{6},\overset{y_2}{27})</m>.
        Here, <m>x_1</m> and <m>y_1</m> represent the first point's <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values,
        and <m>x_2</m> and <m>y_2</m> represent the second point's <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we can write an alternative to <xref ref="equation-slope-definition"/>:
        <men xml:id="equation-slope-formula">
          \text{slope}=m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
        </men>
        This is known as the <term>slope formula</term>. The following graphs help to understand why          <idx><h>Slope</h><h>formula</h></idx>
        this formula works. Basically, we are still using a slope triangle to calculate the slope.

    <warning>
      <p>
        It's important to use subscript instead of superscript in the slope equation, because
        <m>y^2</m> means to take the number <m>y</m> and square it. When we use <m>y_2</m>, we are
        saying there are at least two <m>y</m>-values in the conversation, and <m>y_2</m> is the
        second of them.
      </p>
    </warning>

    <p>
      The beauty of the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref> is
      that to find a line's slope, we don't need to draw a slope triangle. Let's look at an example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A line passes the points <m>(-5,25)</m> and <m>(4,-2)</m>. Find this line's slope.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          If you are new to this formula, it may help to label each number before using the formula.
          The two given points are:
          <me>
            (\overset{x_1}{-5},\overset{y_1}{25}) \qquad (\overset{x_2}{4},\overset{y_2}{-2})
          </me>
          Now apply the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref>:
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{-2-25}{4-(-5)}</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we used parentheses when substituting negative numbers in <m>x_1</m> and
          <m>y_1</m>. This is a good habit to protect yourself from making errors with subtraction
          and double negatives.

            To find a line's slope, we can use the slope formula:
            <me>\text{slope}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</me>
            First, we mark which number corresponds to which variable in the formula:
            <me>(\overset{x_1}{-18},\overset{y_1}{14})\qquad(\overset{x_2}{18},\overset{y_2}{-16})</me>
            Now we substitute these numbers into the corresponding variables in the slope formula:
            <md>
              <mrow>\text{slope} \amp =\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp =\frac{-16-14}{18-(-18)}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp =\frac{-30}{36}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp =\frac{-5}{6}</mrow>
            </md>
            So the line's slope is <m>-\frac56</m>.

              Do your best to identify two points on the line (which are not necessarily the plotted
              data points). With this line, it seems <m>(2000,17500)</m> and <m>(2020,23000)</m> are
              two such points.
            </p>
            <p>
              <me>
                \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{(23000-17500)\,\text{diagnoses}}{(2020-2000)\,\text{yr}}=275\,\frac{\text{diagnoses}}{\text{yr}}
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              So the slope is about <m>275</m> diagnoses per year. This is only an estimate since we
              are not certain the two points we chose are actually on the line.
